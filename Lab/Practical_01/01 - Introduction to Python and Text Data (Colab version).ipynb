Oh dear! I shall be late!\\' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n\\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\\n\\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\\n\\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE\\', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\\n\\n`Well!\\' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!

How funny it\\'ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--\\' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn\\'t sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.

There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. `Dinah\\'ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\\' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they\\'ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\\'m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\\'s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\\' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\\' and sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?\\' for, you see, as she couldn\\'t answer either question, it didn\\'t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\\' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\\n\\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it\\'s getting!\\' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\\n\\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\\n\\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\\'s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\\n\\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if my head would go through,\\' thought poor Alice, `it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.\\' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\\n\\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,\\' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME\\' beautifully printed on it in large letters.\\n\\nIt was all very well to say `Drink me,\\' but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. `No, I\\'ll look first,\\' she said, `and see whether it\\'s marked \"poison\" or not\\'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,\\' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\\n\\nHowever, this bottle was not marked `poison,\\' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\\n\\n`What a curious feeling!\\' said Alice; `I must be shutting up like a telescope.\\'\\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might end, you know,\\' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\\' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\\n\\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\\n\\n`Come, there\\'s no use in crying like that!\\' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!\\' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it\\'s no use now,\\' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why, there\\'s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!\\'\\n\\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words `EAT ME\\' were beautifully marked in currants. `Well, I\\'ll eat it,\\' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\\'ll get into the garden, and I don\\'t care which happens!\\'\\n\\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which way? Which way?\\', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\\n\\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}],"source":["doc2"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JEDHeg0EbKq3"},"source":["Note all the backslash characters '\\\\' in the text above.  \n","- Python stores text as one big string (sequence of characters). \n","- Special characters such as newlines and tabs are represented by '\\\\n' and '\\\\t' respectively.\n","- The quote character is used to mark the start and end of the string ('string'), so quote characters that are present in the string are prefixed by a backslash to prevent the string from ending early ('str\\\\'ing'). \n","- Using the print() command, we can output the string in a format that we're more used to seeing it in:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{"id":"3m9q8V4QbKq3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677088147149,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":487,"user":{"displayName":"Erik Galler","userId":"10641819115597978698"}},"outputId":"f41fd3aa-76bb-45b5-a6da-bc4870e35a09"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\n","So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n","\n","There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear!

How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\n","\n","There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n","\n","It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n","\n","However, this bottle was not marked `poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n","\n","`What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up like a telescope.'\n","And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\n","\n","After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n","\n","`Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!' She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!'\n","\n","Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. `Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'\n","\n","She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\n","\n","So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n"]}],"source":["print(doc2)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TiCwKJ_VbKq3"},"source":["### Splitting lines and finding words\n","\n","We can split the text into separate lines using splitlines() method. \n","- Since there are lot of lines, we'll only print the first 5 of them by appending `[:5]` to the name of the variable contianing them"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"aLyhzsTQbKq3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677088172075,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":413,"user":{"displayName":"Erik Galler","userId":"10641819115597978698"}},"outputId":"201a7f07-093c-492f-9202-bdd4bacbf8af"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[\"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\",\n"," 'So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.',\n"," '',\n"," \"There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, `Oh dear!

The desert of Frank Herbert’s classic novel is a vast ocean of sand, with giant worms diving into the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain of Shai-hulud. Dune tops are like the crests of waves, and there are powerful sandstorms out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis, life is said to emanate from the Maker (Shai-hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all life on Earth is believed to have evolved from our oceans.

The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as \"parasites\".

Many such marriages are quietly maneuvered by the Bene Gesserit to produce offspring with some genetic characteristics needed by the sisterhood’s human-breeding program.

In 2003, it was described as the world's best-selling science fiction novel.\\n\", 'Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.  It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or \"spice\", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.\\n', \"Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.\\n\", \"Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to a mostly negative response from critics and failed at the box office. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). A second film adaptation directed by Denis Villeneuve was released on October 21, 2021, to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $401 million worldwide. It also went on to win six Academy Awards. Villeneuve's film was essentially the first half of the original novel, and a sequel, which will cover the remaining story, has begun production and is set for release in 2023. The series has been used as the basis for several board, role-playing, and video games.\\n\", \"Since 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real-life nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon Titan.\\n\", 'After his novel The Dragon in the Sea was published in 1957, Herbert traveled to Florence, Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon Dunes. Here, the United States Department of Agriculture was attempting to use poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes. Herbert claimed in a letter to his literary agent, Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes could \"swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways.\"[2] Herbert\\'s article on the dunes, \"They Stopped the Moving Sands\", was never completed (and only published decades later in The Road to Dune), but its research sparked Herbert\\'s interest in ecology and deserts.[3]\\n', 'Herbert further drew inspiration from Native American mentors like “Indian Henry” (as Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a Henry Martin of the Hoh tribe) and Howard Hansen. Both Martin and Hansen grew up on the Quileute reservation near Herbert\\'s hometown. According to historian Daniel Immerwahr, Hansen regularly shared his writing with Herbert. \"White men are eating the earth,” Hansen told Herbert in 1958, after sharing a piece on the effect of logging on the Quileute reservation. “They’re gonna turn this whole planet into a wasteland, just like North Africa.” The world could become a “big dune,\" Herbert responded in agreement.[4]\\n', \"Herbert was also interested in the idea of the superhero mystique and messiahs. He believed that feudalism was a natural condition humans fell into, where some led and others gave up the responsibility of making decisions and just followed orders. He found that desert environments have historically given birth to several major religions with messianic impulses. He decided to join his interests together so he could play religious and ecological ideas against each other. In addition, he was influenced by the story of T. E. Lawrence and the “messianic overtones” in Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt during World War I. In an early version of Dune, the hero was actually very similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was too straightforward and added more layers to his story.[5]\\n\", \"Herbert drew heavy inspiration also from Lesley Blanch's The Sabres of Paradise (1960), a narrative history recounting a mid-19th century conflict in the Caucasus, between rugged Islamized Turkic tribes and the expansive Russian Empire.[6] Language used on both sides of that conflict become terms in Herbert's world—chakobsa, a Caucasian hunting language, becomes a battle language of humans spread across the galaxy; kanly, a word for blood feud in the 19th century Caucasus, represents a feud between Dune's noble Houses; sietch and tabir are both words for camp borrowed from Ukrainian Cossacks (of the Pontic–Caspian steppe).[6]\\n\", 'Herbert also borrowed some lines which Blanch stated were Caucasian proverbs. \"To kill with the point lacked artistry\", used by Blanch to describe the Caucasus peoples\\' love of swordsmanship, becomes in Dune \"Killing with the tip lacks artistry\", a piece of advice given to a young Paul during his training. \"Polish comes from the city, wisdom from the hills\", a Caucasian aphorism, turns into a desert expression: \"Polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert\".[6]\\n', \"\\nAnother significant source of inspiration for Dune was Herbert's experiences with psilocybin and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms, according to mycologist Paul Stamets's account of meeting Herbert in the 1980s:[7]\", 'Frank went on to tell me that much of the premise of Dune—the magic spice (spores) that allowed the bending of space (tripping), the giant sand worms (maggots digesting mushrooms), the eyes of the Fremen (the cerulean blue of Psilocybe mushrooms), the mysticism of the female spiritual warriors, the Bene Gesserits (influenced by the tales of Maria Sabina and the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico)—came from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and his imagination was stimulated through his experiences with the use of magic mushrooms.', 'Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising. He published a three-part serial Dune World in the monthly Analog, from December 1963 to February 1964. The serial was accompanied by several illustrations that were not published again. After an interval of a year, he published the much slower-paced five-part The Prophet of Dune in the January–May 1965 issues.[8][9] The first serial became \"Book 1: Dune\" in the final published Dune novel, and the second serial was divided into \"Book Two: Muad\\'dib\" and \"Book Three: The Prophet\". The serialized version was expanded, reworked, and submitted to more than twenty publishers, each of whom rejected it. The novel, Dune, was finally accepted and published in August 1965 by Chilton Books, a printing house better known for publishing auto repair manuals.[10] Sterling Lanier, an editor at Chilton, had seen Herbert\\'s manuscript and had urged his company to take a risk in publishing the book. However, the first printing, priced at $5.95 (equivalent to $51.16 in 2021), did not sell well and was poorly received by critics as being atypical of science fiction at the time. Chilton considered the publication of Dune a write-off and Lanier was fired.[11] Over the course of time, the book gained critical acclaim, and its popularity spread by word-of-mouth to allow Herbert to start working full time on developing the sequels to Dune, elements of which were already written alongside Dune.[12]\\n', 'At first Herbert considered using Mars as setting for his novel, but eventually decided to use a fictional planet instead. His son Brian said that \"Readers would have too many preconceived ideas about that planet, due to the number of stories that had been written about it.\"[13]\\n', 'Herbert dedicated his work \"to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of \\'real materials\\'—to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"[14]\\n', 'Duke Leto Atreides of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of the planet Arrakis. Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source of melange, or the \"spice\", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. It is also through the consumption of spice that Spacing Guild Navigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel. Shaddam sees House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat, and conspires with House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of House Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival. Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind, but is compelled to obey the Emperor’s orders anyway.\\n', \"Leto's concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and wields seemingly superhuman physical and mental abilities, such as the ability to decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of their breeding program, out of love for Leto she bore a son, Paul. From a young age, Paul has been trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiers Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck. Thufir Hawat, the Duke's Mentat (people with superhuman intelligence), has instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue. Jessica has also trained her son in what Bene Gesserit disciplines she can. His prophetic dreams interest Jessica's superior, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, who subjects Paul to the gom jabbar, a deadly test that causes blinding pain as part of an assessment of the subject's self-control. To her surprise, Paul passes despite being exposed to more pain than anyone else before him.\\n\", \"Leto, Jessica, and Paul travel with their household to occupy Arrakeen, the capital on Arrakis formerly held by House Harkonnen. Leto learns of the dangers involved in harvesting the spice, which is protected by giant sandworms, and negotiates with the planet's native Fremen people, seeing them as a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the Atreides' arrival, Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's ferocious Sardaukar troops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his personal physician, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, who delivers a drugged Leto to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his twisted Mentat, Piter De Vries. Yueh, however, arranges for Jessica and Paul to escape into the desert, where they are presumed dead by the Harkonnens. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule, hoping Leto can kill the Baron during their encounter. The Baron narrowly avoids the gas due to his shield, which instead kills Leto, De Vries, and others. The Baron forces Hawat to take over De Vries' position by dosing him with a long-lasting, fatal poison and threatening to withhold the regular antidote doses unless he obeys. While he follows the Baron's orders, Hawat works secretly to undermine the Harkonnens.\\n\", 'After fleeing into the desert, Paul realizes he has significant powers as a result of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme, inadvertently caused by Jessica bearing a son and his exposure to high concentrations of spice. In visions, he foresees futures in which he lives among the planet\\'s native Fremen, and is also informed of the addictive qualities of the spice. It is revealed Jessica is the daughter of Baron Harkonnen, a secret kept from her by the Bene Gesserit. After being captured by Fremen, Paul and Jessica are accepted into the Fremen community of Sietch Tabr, and teach them the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known as the \"weirding way\". Paul proves his manhood by killing a Fremen named Jamis in a ritualistic crysknife fight and chooses the Fremen name Muad\\'Dib, while Jessica opts to undergo a ritual to become a Reverend Mother by drinking the poisonous Water of Life. Pregnant with Leto\\'s daughter, she inadvertently causes the unborn child, Alia, to become infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover, Chani, and has a son with her, Leto II.\\n', \"Two years pass and Paul's powerful prescience manifests, which confirms for the Fremen that he is their prophesied messiah, a legend planted by the Bene Gesserit's Missionaria Protectiva. Paul embraces his father's belief that the Fremen could be a powerful fighting force to take back Arrakis, but also sees that if he does not control them, their jihad could consume the entire universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both Baron Harkonnen and the Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly destructive raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephew Glossu Rabban to rule with an iron fist, hoping the contrast with his shrewder nephew Feyd-Rautha will make the latter popular among the people of Arrakis when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the Baron of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to seize power, sends spies to monitor activity on Arrakis. Hawat uses the opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true plans, putting further strain on their alliance.\\n\", \"Gurney, having survived the Harkonnen coup to become a smuggler, reunites with Paul and Jessica after a Fremen raid on his harvester. Believing Jessica to be the traitor, Gurney threatens to kill her, but is stopped by Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack, and concludes he must increase his prescience by drinking the Water of Life, which is traditionally fatal to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for several weeks after drinking the poison, but when he wakes, he has clairvoyance across time and space: he is the Kwisatz Haderach, the ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.\\n\", \"Paul senses the Emperor and Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major offensive against the Harkonnen troops. The Emperor arrives with the Baron on Arrakis. The Emperor’s troops seize a Fremen outpost, killing many including young Leto II, while Alia is captured and taken to the Emperor. Under cover of an electric storm, which shorts out the Emperor's troops' defensive shields, Paul and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, assault the capital while Alia assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen quickly defeat both the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops.\\n\", \"Paul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever unless Shaddam abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha attempts to stop Paul by challenging him to a ritualistic knife fight, during which he attempts to cheat and kill Paul with a poison spur in his belt. Paul gains the upper hand and kills him. The Emperor reluctantly cedes the throne to Paul and promises his daughter Princess Irulan's hand in marriage. As Paul takes control of the Empire, he realizes that while he has achieved his goal, he is no longer able to stop the Fremen jihad, as their belief in him is too powerful to restrain.\\n\", 'The Dune series is a landmark of science fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his Dune universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity\\'s technology. For example, a key pre-history event to the novel\\'s present is the \"Butlerian Jihad\", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity.[12] Dune considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.[1] Director John Harrison, who adapted Dune for Syfy\\'s 2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:\\n', \"A lot of people refer to Dune as science fiction. I never do. I consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition, a story of myth and legend not unlike the Morte d'Arthur or any messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future ... The story is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it. In the 1960s, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out. Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity necessary to all.[15]\", 'But Dune has also been called a mix of soft and hard science fiction since \"the attention to ecology is hard, the anthropology and the psychic abilities are soft.\"[16] Hard elements include the ecology of Arrakis, suspensor technology, weapon systems, and ornithopters, while soft elements include issues relating to religion, physical and mental training, cultures, politics, and psychology.[17]\\n', \"Herbert said Paul's messiah figure was inspired by the Arthurian legend,[18] and that the scarcity of water on Arrakis was a metaphor for oil, as well as air and water itself, and for the shortages of resources caused by overpopulation.[19] Novelist Brian Herbert, his son and biographer, wrote:\\n\", 'Dune is a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange, the geriatric spice that represents, among other things, the finite resource of oil. The planet Arrakis features immense, ferocious worms that are like dragons of lore, with \"great teeth\" and a \"bellows breath of cinnamon.\" This resembles the myth described by an unknown English poet in Beowulf, the compelling tale of a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs, at the edge of the sea. The desert of Frank Herbert’s classic novel is a vast ocean of sand, with giant worms diving into the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain of Shai-hulud. Dune tops are like the crests of waves, and there are powerful sandstorms out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis, life is said to emanate from the Maker (Shai-hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all life on Earth is believed to have evolved from our oceans. Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren’t so different from systems we know … and the book characters of his imagination are not so different from people familiar to us.[20]', 'Each chapter of Dune begins with an epigraph excerpted from the fictional writings of the character Princess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert\\'s complex fictional universe and themes.[21][22][23] They act as foreshadowing and invite the reader to keep reading to close the gap between what the epigraph says and what is happening in the main narrative.[24] The epigraphs also give the reader the feeling that the world they are reading about is epically distanced, since Irulan writes about an idealized image of Paul as if he had already passed into memory.[25] Brian Herbert wrote: \"Dad told me that you could follow any of the novel\\'s layers as you read it, and then start the book all over again, focusing on an entirely different layer. At the end of the book, he intentionally left loose ends and said he did this to send the readers spinning out of the story with bits and pieces of it still clinging to them, so that they would want to go back and read it again.\"[26]\\n', 'Due to the similarities between some of Herbert\\'s terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in the Arabic language, as well as the series\\' \"Islamic undertones\" and themes, a Middle-Eastern influence on Herbert\\'s works has been noted repeatedly.[27][28] In his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words.[29][30] For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived from Arabic: شيء خلود, romanized:\\xa0šayʾ ḫulūd, lit.\\u2009\\'immortal thing\\' or Arabic: شيخ خلود, romanized:\\xa0šayḫ ḫulūd, lit.\\u2009\\'old man of eternity\\'.[31][30] The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from the Arabic: شادوف\\u200e, romanized:\\xa0šādūf, the Egyptian term for a device used to raise water.[30] In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad\\'Dib (from Arabic: مؤدب, romanized:\\xa0muʾaddib, lit.\\u2009\\'educator\\'), Usul (from Arabic: أصول, romanized:\\xa0ʾuṣūl, lit.\\u2009\\'fundamental principles\\'), Shari-a (from Arabic: شريعة, romanized:\\xa0šarīʿa, lit.\\u2009\\'sharia; path\\'), Shaitan (from Arabic: شيطان, romanized:\\xa0šayṭān, lit.\\u2009\\'Shaitan; devil; fiend\\', and jinn (from Arabic: جن, romanized:\\xa0ǧinn, lit.\\u2009\\'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being\\').[27] It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen.[30] They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an \"imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references\" and has a distinctly Bedouin aesthetic.[30]\\n', 'As a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides bears many similarities to the historical T. E. Lawrence.[32] His 1962 biopic Lawrence of Arabia has also been identified as a potential influence.[33] The Sabres of Paradise (1960) has also been identified as a potential influence upon Dune, with its depiction of Imam Shamil and the Islamic culture of the Caucasus inspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology of Dune.[6]\\n', 'The environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by the environments of the Middle East. Similarly Arrakis as a bioregion is presented as a particular kind of political site. Herbert has made it resemble a desertified petrostate area.[34] The Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia, and the Mahdi prophecy originates from Islamic eschatology.[35] Inspiration is also adopted from medieval historian Ibn Khaldun\\'s cyclical history and his dynastic concept in North Africa, hinted at by Herbert\\'s reference to Khaldun\\'s book Kitāb al-ʿibar (\"The Book of Lessons\"). The fictionalized version of the \"Kitab al-ibar\" in Dune is a combination of a Fremen religious manual and a desert survival book.[36][37]\\n', 'In addition to Arabic, Dune derives words and names from a variety of other languages, including Hebrew, Navajo, Latin, Dutch (“Landsraad”), Chakobsa, the Nahuatl language of the Aztecs, Greek, Persian, Sanskrit (“prana bindu”, “prajna”), Russian, Turkish, Finnish, and Old English.[38] Bene Gesserit is derived from the Latin meaning \"it will have been well borne\" symbolizing their doctrine in the story.[39]\\n', 'Through the inspiration from The Sabres of Paradise, there are also allusions to the tsarist-era Russian nobility and Cossacks.[40] Frank Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind the aristocratic families in Dune was \"aristocratic bureaucracy\" which he saw as analogous to the Soviet Union.[41][42]\\n', 'Dune has been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale\".[43] Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awareness handbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of \\'doom\\'\".[44] It was reviewed in the best selling countercultural Whole Earth Catalog in 1968 as a \"rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community”.[45]\\n', \"After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. Dune responded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life forms adapted to live with limited water. Dune was followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such as A Door into Ocean (1986) and Red Mars (1992).[43] Environmentalists have pointed out that Dune's popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex—almost living—thing, in combination with the first images of Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the international Earth Day.[46]\\n\", 'While the genre of climate fiction was popularized in the 2010s in response to real global climate change, Dune as well as other early science fiction works from authors like J. G. Ballard (The Drowned World) and Kim Stanley Robinson (the Mars trilogy) have retroactively been considered pioneering examples of the genre.[47][48]\\n', 'The Imperium in Dune contains features of various empires in Europe and the near East, including the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, and Ottoman Empire.[49][31][50] Lorenzo DiTommaso compared Dune\\'s portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to Edward Gibbon\\'s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which argues that Christianity allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of Ancient Rome. In \"The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction\" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as \"parasites\". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt and materially indulgent. Gibbon\\'s Decline and Fall partly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack. The Emperor\\'s Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the Sardaukar\\'s overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen\\'s capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others.[51]\\n', 'The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal by genetic mixing of successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides, described by Frank Herbert as depicting \"war as a collective orgasm\" (drawing on Norman Walter\\'s 1950 The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare),[52][53] themes that would reappear in God Emperor of Dune\\'s Scattering and Leto II\\'s all-female Fish Speaker army.\\n', 'Gender dynamics are complex in Dune.   Within the Fremen sietch communities, women have almost full equality.  They carry weapons and travel in raiding parties with men, fighting when necessary alongside the men.  They can take positions of leadership as a Sayyadina or as a Reverend Mother (if she can survive the ritual of ingesting the Water of Life.)  Both of these sietch religious leaders are routinely consulted by the all-male Council and can have a decisive voice in all matters of sietch life, security and internal politics.  They are also protected by the entire community.  Due to the high mortality rate among their men, women outnumber men in most sietches. Polygamy is common, and sexual relationships are voluntary and consensual; as Stilgar says to Jessica, “women among us are not taken against their will.”  \\n', 'In contrast, the Imperial aristocracy leaves young women of noble birth very little agency. Frequently trained by the Bene Gesserit, they are raised to eventually marry other aristocrats. Marriages between Major and Minor Houses are political tools to forge alliances or heal old feuds; women are given very little say in the matter. Many such marriages are quietly maneuvered by the Bene Gesserit to produce offspring with some genetic characteristics needed by the sisterhood’s human-breeding program. In addition, such highly-placed sisters were in a position to subtly influence their husbands’ actions in ways that could move the politics of the Imperium toward Bene Gesserit goals. \\n', \"The gom jabbar test of humanity is administered by the female Bene Gesserit order but rarely to males.[54] The Bene Gesserit have seemingly mastered the unconscious and can play on the unconscious weaknesses of others using the Voice, yet their breeding program seeks after a male Kwisatz Haderach.[32] Their plan is to produce a male who can “possess complete racial memory, both male and female,” and look into the black hole in the collective unconscious that they fear.[55] A central theme of the book is the connection, in Jessica's son, of this female aspect with his male aspect. This aligns with concepts in Jungian psychology, which features conscious/unconscious and taking/giving roles associated with males and females, as well as the idea of the collective unconscious.[56] Paul's approach to power consistently requires his upbringing under the matriarchal Bene Gesserit, who operate as a long-dominating shadow government behind all of the great houses and their marriages or divisions.[55] He is trained by Jessica in the Bene Gesserit Way, which includes prana-bindu training in nerve and muscle control and precise perception.[57] Paul also receives Mentat training, thus helping prepare him to be a type of androgynous Kwisatz Haderach, a male Reverend Mother.[55]\\n\", 'In a Bene Gesserit test early in the book, it is implied that people are generally \"inhuman\" in that they irrationally place desire over self-interest and reason.[citation needed] This applies Herbert\\'s philosophy that humans are not created equal, while equal justice and equal opportunity are higher ideals than mental, physical, or moral equality.[58]\\n', 'I am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation in it.', 'Throughout Paul\\'s rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many stories describing the birth of a hero.[60] He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.[61][62] As such, Dune is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means.[63] Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causes the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, \"The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better  [to] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.\"[64] He wrote in 1985, \"Dune was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader\\'s name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.\"[65]\\n', 'Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul\\'s superpowers, differentiating the heroes of Dune from earlier heroes such as Superman, van Vogt\\'s Gilbert Gosseyn and Henry Kuttner\\'s telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul\\'s are the result of \"painful and slow personal progress.\" And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert\\'s characters grow their powers through \"the application of mystical philosophies and techniques.\" For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, Ginaz swordsmen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).[66]\\n', 'Early in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced to Zen by two Jungian psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who \"gave a crucial boost to his thinking\".[67] Zen teachings ultimately had \"a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert\\'s] work\".[67] Throughout the Dune series and particularly in Dune, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from Zen Buddhism.[67][68] The Fremen are Zensunni adherents, and many of Herbert\\'s epigraphs are Zen-spirited.[69] In \"Dune Genesis\", Frank Herbert wrote:\\n', 'What especially pleases me is to see the interwoven themes, the fugue like relationships of images that exactly replay the way Dune took shape. As in an Escher lithograph, I involved myself with recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul\\'s gift of prescience - the Presbyterian fixation? For the Delphic Oracle to perform, it must tangle itself in a web of predestination. Yet predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It\\'s like a koan, a Zen mind breaker. It\\'s like the Cretan Epimenides saying, \"All Cretans are liars.\"[58]', 'Brian Herbert called the Dune universe \"a spiritual melting pot\", noting that his father incorporated elements of a variety of religions, including Buddhism, Sufi mysticism and other Islamic belief systems, Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, and Hinduism.[70] He added that Frank Herbert\\'s fictional future in which \"religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms\" represents the author\\'s solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claimed to have \"the one and only revelation.\"[70][71]\\n', 'Tim O\\'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wrote Dune as a counterpoint to Isaac Asimov\\'s Foundation series. In his monograph on Frank Herbert, O\\'Reilly wrote that \"Dune is clearly a commentary on the Foundation trilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov\\'s classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced into Dune is that the Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.\"[72] According to O\\'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical science.[72] In contrast to the Foundation series and its praise of science and rationality, Dune proposes that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity.[72]\\n', 'However, both works contain a similar theme of the restoration of civilization[73] and seem to make the fundamental assumption that “political maneuvering, the need to control material resources, and friendship or mating bonds will be fundamentally the same in the future as they are now.”[74]\\n', \"Dune tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966[75] and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.[76] Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, and Dune is considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written.[77] The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies.[78] Dune has been regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.[79][80]\\n\", 'Arthur C. Clarke described Dune as \"unique\" and wrote, \"I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings.\"[81] Robert A. Heinlein described the novel as \"powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.\"[81][82] It was described as \"one of the monuments of modern science fiction\" by the Chicago Tribune,[81] and P. Schuyler Miller called Dune \"one of the landmarks of modern science fiction ... an amazing feat of creation.\"[82] The Washington Post described it as \"a portrayal of an alien society more complete and deeply detailed than any other author in the field has managed ... a story absorbing equally for its action and philosophical vistas ... An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.\"[81][82] Algis Budrys praised Dune for the vividness of its imagined setting, saying \"The time lives. It breathes, it speaks, and Herbert has smelt it in his nostrils\". He found that the novel, however, \"turns flat and tails off at the end. ... [T]ruly effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning statesmen and seeresses all bend before this new Messiah\". Budrys faulted in particular Herbert\\'s decision to kill Paul\\'s infant son offstage, with no apparent emotional impact, saying \"you cannot be so busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek\".[83] After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed Dune as among stories \"that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical\".[84]\\n', 'The Louisville Times wrote, \"Herbert\\'s creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics, and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.\"[82] Writing for The New Yorker, Jon Michaud praises Herbert\\'s \"clever authorial decision\" to exclude robots and computers (\"two staples of the genre\") from his fictional universe, but suggests that this may be one explanation why Dune lacks \"true fandom among science-fiction fans\" to the extent that it \"has not penetrated popular culture in the way that The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars have\".[12] Tamara I. Hladik wrote that the story \"crafts a universe where lesser novels promulgate excuses for sequels. All its rich elements are in balance and plausible—not the patchwork confederacy of made-up languages, contrived customs, and meaningless histories that are the hallmark of so many other, lesser novels.\"[85]\\n', 'On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Dune on its list of the 100 most influential novels.[86]\\n', 'J. R. R. Tolkien refused to review Dune, on the grounds that he disliked it \"with some intensity\" and thus felt it would be unfair to Herbert, another working author, if he gave an honest review of the book.[87]\\n', 'The first edition of Dune is one of the most valuable in science fiction book collecting.

He had already drafted parts of the second and third while writing Dune.[12] The series included Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), each sequentially continuing on the narrative from Dune. Herbert died on February 11, 1986.[91]\\n', \"Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, had found several thousand pages of notes left by his father that outlined ideas for other narratives related to Dune. Brian Herbert enlisted author Kevin J. Anderson to help build out prequel novels to the events of Dune. Brian Herbert's and Anderson's Dune prequels first started publication in 1999, and have led to additional stories that take place between those of Frank Herbert's books.[92] The notes for what would have been Dune 7 also enabled them to publish Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), sequels to Frank Herbert's final novel Chapterhouse: Dune, which complete the chronological progression of his original series, and wrap up storylines that began in Heretics of Dune.\\n\", 'Dune has been considered as an \"unfilmable\" and \"uncontainable\" work to adapt from novel to film or other visual medium.[93] Described by Wired, \"It has four appendices and a glossary of its own gibberish, and its action takes place on two planets, one of which is a desert overrun by worms the size of airport runways. Lots of important people die or try to kill each other, and they\\'re all tethered to about eight entangled subplots.\"[94] There have been several attempts to achieve this difficult conversion with various degrees of success.[95]\\n', \"In 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by Arthur P. Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune. As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel to Planet of the Apes, Dune was delayed for another year. Jacobs' first choice for director was David Lean, but he turned down the offer. Charles Jarrott was also considered to direct. Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued. Initially, the first treatment had been handled by Robert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequently Rospo Pallenberg was approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974. However, Jacobs died in 1973.[96]\\n\", \"In December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights from APJ, with Alejandro Jodorowsky set to direct.[97] In 1975, Jodorowsky planned to film the story as a 10-hour feature, set to star his own son Brontis Jodorowsky in the lead role of Paul Atreides, Salvador Dalí as Shaddam IV, Padishah Emperor, Amanda Lear as Princess Irulan, Orson Welles as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Gloria Swanson as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, David Carradine as Duke Leto Atreides, Geraldine Chaplin as Lady Jessica, Alain Delon as Duncan Idaho, Hervé Villechaize as Gurney Halleck, Udo Kier as Piter De Vries, and Mick Jagger as Feyd-Rautha. It was at first proposed to score the film with original music by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Henry Cow, and Magma; later on, the soundtrack was to be provided by Pink Floyd.[98] Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting of Chris Foss, a British artist who designed covers for science fiction periodicals, Jean Giraud (Moebius), a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for Metal Hurlant magazine, and H. R. Giger.[97] Moebius began designing creatures and characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to design the film's space ships and hardware.[97] Giger began designing the Harkonnen Castle based on Moebius's storyboards. Dan O'Bannon was to head the special effects department.[97]\\n\", 'Dalí was cast as the Emperor.[97] Dalí later demanded to be paid $100,000 per hour; Jodorowsky agreed, but tailored Dalí\\'s part to be filmed in one hour, drafting plans for other scenes of the emperor to use a mechanical mannequin as substitute for Dalí.[97] According to Giger, Dalí was \"later invited to leave the film because of his pro-Franco statements\".[99] Just as the storyboards, designs, and script were finished, the financial backing dried up. Frank Herbert traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky\\'s script would result in a 14-hour movie (\"It was the size of a phone book\", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. Jodorowsky said in 1985 that he found the Dune story mythical and had intended to recreate it rather than adapt the novel; though he had an \"enthusiastic admiration\" for Herbert, Jodorowsky said he had done everything possible to distance the author and his input from the project.[97] Although Jodorowsky was embittered by the experience, he said the Dune project changed his life, and some of the ideas were used in his and Moebius\\'s The Incal.[100] O\\'Bannon entered a psychiatric hospital after the production failed, then worked on 13 scripts, the last of which became Alien.[97] A 2013 documentary, Jodorowsky\\'s Dune, was made about Jodorowsky\\'s failed attempt at an adaptation.\\n', \"In 1976, Dino De Laurentiis acquired the rights from Gibon's consortium. De Laurentiis commissioned Herbert to write a new screenplay in 1978; the script Herbert turned in was 175 pages long, the equivalent of nearly three hours of screen time. De Laurentiis then hired director Ridley Scott in 1979, with Rudy Wurlitzer writing the screenplay and H. R. Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production; Scott and Giger had also just worked together on the film Alien, after O'Bannon recommended the artist.[101][102] Scott intended to split the novel into two movies. He worked on three drafts of the script, using The Battle of Algiers as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science fiction film, Blade Runner (1982). As he recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:\\n\", \"But after seven months I dropped out of Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer had come up with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent distillation of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was going to take a lot more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.\\n\", \"In 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the Dune sequels (written and unwritten). After seeing The Elephant Man, De Laurentiis' daughter Raffaella decided that David Lynch should direct the movie. Around that time Lynch received several other directing offers, including Return of the Jedi. He agreed to direct Dune and write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science fiction.[103] Lynch worked on the script for six months with Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts. Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's timeline.[104] Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour long film, but at demands from Universal Pictures, the film's distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage.[105]\\n\", 'This first film of Dune, directed by Lynch, was released in 1984, nearly 20 years after the book\\'s publication. Though Herbert said the book\\'s depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he was pleased with the film, saying that \"They\\'ve got it. It begins as Dune does. And I hear my dialogue all the way through. There are some interpretations and liberties, but you\\'re gonna come out knowing you\\'ve seen Dune.\"[106] Reviews of the film were negative, saying that it was incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book\\'s plot.[107][108][109][93][110] Upon release for television and other forms of home media, Universal opted to reintroduce much of the footage that Lynch had cut, creating an over-three-hour long version with extensive monologue exposition. Lynch was extremely displeased with this move, and demanded that Universal replace his name on these cuts with the pseudonym \"Alan Smithee\", and has generally distanced himself from the film since.[105]\\n', \"In 2000, John Harrison adapted the novel into Frank Herbert's Dune, a miniseries which premiered on American Sci-Fi Channel.[15] As of 2004, the miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel.[111]\\n\", 'In 2008, Paramount Pictures announced that they would produce a new film based on the book, with Peter Berg attached to direct.[112] Producer Kevin Misher, who spent a year securing the rights from the Herbert estate, was to be joined by Richard Rubinstein and John Harrison (of both Sci Fi Channel miniseries) as well as Sarah Aubrey and Mike Messina.[112] The producers stated that they were going for a \"faithful adaptation\" of the novel, and considered \"its theme of finite ecological resources particularly timely.\"[112] Science fiction author Kevin J.

It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 and it won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel. It is the first installment of the Dune saga. In 2003, it was described as the world's best-selling science fiction novel.\n","\n","Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs.  It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or \"spice\", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.\n","\n","Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune. Following Herbert's death in 1986, his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J. Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999.\n","\n","Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. After three years of development, the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to a mostly negative response from critics and failed at the box office. The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). A second film adaptation directed by Denis Villeneuve was released on October 21, 2021, to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $401 million worldwide. It also went on to win six Academy Awards. Villeneuve's film was essentially the first half of the original novel, and a sequel, which will cover the remaining story, has begun production and is set for release in 2023. The series has been used as the basis for several board, role-playing, and video games.\n","\n","Since 2009, the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real-life nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn's moon Titan.\n","\n","After his novel The Dragon in the Sea was published in 1957, Herbert traveled to Florence, Oregon, at the north end of the Oregon Dunes. Here, the United States Department of Agriculture was attempting to use poverty grasses to stabilize the sand dunes. Herbert claimed in a letter to his literary agent, Lurton Blassingame, that the moving dunes could \"swallow whole cities, lakes, rivers, highways.\"[2] Herbert's article on the dunes, \"They Stopped the Moving Sands\", was never completed (and only published decades later in The Road to Dune), but its research sparked Herbert's interest in ecology and deserts.[3]\n","\n","Herbert further drew inspiration from Native American mentors like “Indian Henry” (as Herbert referred to the man to his son; likely a Henry Martin of the Hoh tribe) and Howard Hansen. Both Martin and Hansen grew up on the Quileute reservation near Herbert's hometown. According to historian Daniel Immerwahr, Hansen regularly shared his writing with Herbert. \"White men are eating the earth,” Hansen told Herbert in 1958, after sharing a piece on the effect of logging on the Quileute reservation. “They’re gonna turn this whole planet into a wasteland, just like North Africa.” The world could become a “big dune,\" Herbert responded in agreement.[4]\n","\n","Herbert was also interested in the idea of the superhero mystique and messiahs. He believed that feudalism was a natural condition humans fell into, where some led and others gave up the responsibility of making decisions and just followed orders. He found that desert environments have historically given birth to several major religions with messianic impulses. He decided to join his interests together so he could play religious and ecological ideas against each other. In addition, he was influenced by the story of T. E. Lawrence and the “messianic overtones” in Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt during World War I. In an early version of Dune, the hero was actually very similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided the plot was too straightforward and added more layers to his story.[5]\n","\n","Herbert drew heavy inspiration also from Lesley Blanch's The Sabres of Paradise (1960), a narrative history recounting a mid-19th century conflict in the Caucasus, between rugged Islamized Turkic tribes and the expansive Russian Empire.[6] Language used on both sides of that conflict become terms in Herbert's world—chakobsa, a Caucasian hunting language, becomes a battle language of humans spread across the galaxy; kanly, a word for blood feud in the 19th century Caucasus, represents a feud between Dune's noble Houses; sietch and tabir are both words for camp borrowed from Ukrainian Cossacks (of the Pontic–Caspian steppe).[6]\n","\n","Herbert also borrowed some lines which Blanch stated were Caucasian proverbs. \"To kill with the point lacked artistry\", used by Blanch to describe the Caucasus peoples' love of swordsmanship, becomes in Dune \"Killing with the tip lacks artistry\", a piece of advice given to a young Paul during his training. \"Polish comes from the city, wisdom from the hills\", a Caucasian aphorism, turns into a desert expression: \"Polish comes from the cities, wisdom from the desert\".[6]\n","\n","\n","Another significant source of inspiration for Dune was Herbert's experiences with psilocybin and his hobby of cultivating mushrooms, according to mycologist Paul Stamets's account of meeting Herbert in the 1980s:[7]\n","Frank went on to tell me that much of the premise of Dune—the magic spice (spores) that allowed the bending of space (tripping), the giant sand worms (maggots digesting mushrooms), the eyes of the Fremen (the cerulean blue of Psilocybe mushrooms), the mysticism of the female spiritual warriors, the Bene Gesserits (influenced by the tales of Maria Sabina and the sacred mushroom cults of Mexico)—came from his perception of the fungal life cycle, and his imagination was stimulated through his experiences with the use of magic mushrooms.\n","Herbert spent the next five years researching, writing, and revising. He published a three-part serial Dune World in the monthly Analog, from December 1963 to February 1964. The serial was accompanied by several illustrations that were not published again. After an interval of a year, he published the much slower-paced five-part The Prophet of Dune in the January–May 1965 issues.[8][9] The first serial became \"Book 1: Dune\" in the final published Dune novel, and the second serial was divided into \"Book Two: Muad'dib\" and \"Book Three: The Prophet\". The serialized version was expanded, reworked, and submitted to more than twenty publishers, each of whom rejected it. The novel, Dune, was finally accepted and published in August 1965 by Chilton Books, a printing house better known for publishing auto repair manuals.[10] Sterling Lanier, an editor at Chilton, had seen Herbert's manuscript and had urged his company to take a risk in publishing the book. However, the first printing, priced at $5.95 (equivalent to $51.16 in 2021), did not sell well and was poorly received by critics as being atypical of science fiction at the time. Chilton considered the publication of Dune a write-off and Lanier was fired.[11] Over the course of time, the book gained critical acclaim, and its popularity spread by word-of-mouth to allow Herbert to start working full time on developing the sequels to Dune, elements of which were already written alongside Dune.[12]\n","\n","At first Herbert considered using Mars as setting for his novel, but eventually decided to use a fictional planet instead. His son Brian said that \"Readers would have too many preconceived ideas about that planet, due to the number of stories that had been written about it.\"[13]\n","\n","Herbert dedicated his work \"to the people whose labors go beyond ideas into the realm of 'real materials'—to the dry-land ecologists, wherever they may be, in whatever time they work, this effort at prediction is dedicated in humility and admiration.\"[14]\n","\n","Duke Leto Atreides of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of the planet Arrakis. Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source of melange, or the \"spice\", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. It is also through the consumption of spice that Spacing Guild Navigators are able to effect safe interstellar travel. Shaddam sees House Atreides as a potential future rival and threat, and conspires with House Harkonnen, the former stewards of Arrakis and the longstanding enemies of House Atreides, to destroy Leto and his family after their arrival. Leto is aware his assignment is a trap of some kind, but is compelled to obey the Emperor’s orders anyway.\n","\n","Leto's concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusively female group that pursues mysterious political aims and wields seemingly superhuman physical and mental abilities, such as the ability to decide the sex of their children. Though Jessica was instructed by the Bene Gesserit to bear a daughter as part of their breeding program, out of love for Leto she bore a son, Paul. From a young age, Paul has been trained in warfare by Leto's aides, the elite soldiers Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck. Thufir Hawat, the Duke's Mentat (people with superhuman intelligence), has instructed Paul in the ways of political intrigue. Jessica has also trained her son in what Bene Gesserit disciplines she can. His prophetic dreams interest Jessica's superior, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, who subjects Paul to the gom jabbar, a deadly test that causes blinding pain as part of an assessment of the subject's self-control. To her surprise, Paul passes despite being exposed to more pain than anyone else before him.\n","\n","Leto, Jessica, and Paul travel with their household to occupy Arrakeen, the capital on Arrakis formerly held by House Harkonnen. Leto learns of the dangers involved in harvesting the spice, which is protected by giant sandworms, and negotiates with the planet's native Fremen people, seeing them as a valuable ally rather than foes. Soon after the Atreides' arrival, Harkonnen forces attack, joined by the Emperor's ferocious Sardaukar troops in disguise. Leto is betrayed by his personal physician, the Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, who delivers a drugged Leto to the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and his twisted Mentat, Piter De Vries. Yueh, however, arranges for Jessica and Paul to escape into the desert, where they are presumed dead by the Harkonnens. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule, hoping Leto can kill the Baron during their encounter. The Baron narrowly avoids the gas due to his shield, which instead kills Leto, De Vries, and others. The Baron forces Hawat to take over De Vries' position by dosing him with a long-lasting, fatal poison and threatening to withhold the regular antidote doses unless he obeys. While he follows the Baron's orders, Hawat works secretly to undermine the Harkonnens.\n","\n","After fleeing into the desert, Paul realizes he has significant powers as a result of the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme, inadvertently caused by Jessica bearing a son and his exposure to high concentrations of spice. In visions, he foresees futures in which he lives among the planet's native Fremen, and is also informed of the addictive qualities of the spice. It is revealed Jessica is the daughter of Baron Harkonnen, a secret kept from her by the Bene Gesserit. After being captured by Fremen, Paul and Jessica are accepted into the Fremen community of Sietch Tabr, and teach them the Bene Gesserit fighting technique known as the \"weirding way\". Paul proves his manhood by killing a Fremen named Jamis in a ritualistic crysknife fight and chooses the Fremen name Muad'Dib, while Jessica opts to undergo a ritual to become a Reverend Mother by drinking the poisonous Water of Life. Pregnant with Leto's daughter, she inadvertently causes the unborn child, Alia, to become infused with the same powers in the womb. Paul takes a Fremen lover, Chani, and has a son with her, Leto II.\n","\n","Two years pass and Paul's powerful prescience manifests, which confirms for the Fremen that he is their prophesied messiah, a legend planted by the Bene Gesserit's Missionaria Protectiva. Paul embraces his father's belief that the Fremen could be a powerful fighting force to take back Arrakis, but also sees that if he does not control them, their jihad could consume the entire universe. Word of the new Fremen leader reaches both Baron Harkonnen and the Emperor as spice production falls due to their increasingly destructive raids. The Baron encourages his brutish nephew Glossu Rabban to rule with an iron fist, hoping the contrast with his shrewder nephew Feyd-Rautha will make the latter popular among the people of Arrakis when he eventually replaces Rabban. The Emperor, suspecting the Baron of trying to create troops more powerful than the Sardaukar to seize power, sends spies to monitor activity on Arrakis. Hawat uses the opportunity to sow seeds of doubt in the Baron about the Emperor's true plans, putting further strain on their alliance.\n","\n","Gurney, having survived the Harkonnen coup to become a smuggler, reunites with Paul and Jessica after a Fremen raid on his harvester. Believing Jessica to be the traitor, Gurney threatens to kill her, but is stopped by Paul. Paul did not foresee Gurney's attack, and concludes he must increase his prescience by drinking the Water of Life, which is traditionally fatal to males. Paul falls into unconsciousness for several weeks after drinking the poison, but when he wakes, he has clairvoyance across time and space: he is the Kwisatz Haderach, the ultimate goal of the Bene Gesserit breeding program.\n","\n","Paul senses the Emperor and Baron are amassing fleets around Arrakis to quell the Fremen rebellion, and prepares the Fremen for a major offensive against the Harkonnen troops. The Emperor arrives with the Baron on Arrakis. The Emperor’s troops seize a Fremen outpost, killing many including young Leto II, while Alia is captured and taken to the Emperor. Under cover of an electric storm, which shorts out the Emperor's troops' defensive shields, Paul and the Fremen, riding giant sandworms, assault the capital while Alia assassinates the Baron and escapes. The Fremen quickly defeat both the Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops.\n","\n","Paul faces the Emperor, threatening to destroy spice production forever unless Shaddam abdicates the throne. Feyd-Rautha attempts to stop Paul by challenging him to a ritualistic knife fight, during which he attempts to cheat and kill Paul with a poison spur in his belt. Paul gains the upper hand and kills him. The Emperor reluctantly cedes the throne to Paul and promises his daughter Princess Irulan's hand in marriage. As Paul takes control of the Empire, he realizes that while he has achieved his goal, he is no longer able to stop the Fremen jihad, as their belief in him is too powerful to restrain.\n","\n","The Dune series is a landmark of science fiction. Herbert deliberately suppressed technology in his Dune universe so he could address the politics of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's technology. For example, a key pre-history event to the novel's present is the \"Butlerian Jihad\", in which all robots and computers were destroyed, eliminating these common elements to science fiction from the novel as to allow focus on humanity.[12] Dune considers the way humans and their institutions might change over time.[1] Director John Harrison, who adapted Dune for Syfy's 2000 miniseries, called the novel a universal and timeless reflection of \"the human condition and its moral dilemmas\", and said:\n","\n","A lot of people refer to Dune as science fiction. I never do. I consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition, a story of myth and legend not unlike the Morte d'Arthur or any messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future ... The story is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it. In the 1960s, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out. Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity necessary to all.[15]\n","But Dune has also been called a mix of soft and hard science fiction since \"the attention to ecology is hard, the anthropology and the psychic abilities are soft.\"[16] Hard elements include the ecology of Arrakis, suspensor technology, weapon systems, and ornithopters, while soft elements include issues relating to religion, physical and mental training, cultures, politics, and psychology.[17]\n","\n","Herbert said Paul's messiah figure was inspired by the Arthurian legend,[18] and that the scarcity of water on Arrakis was a metaphor for oil, as well as air and water itself, and for the shortages of resources caused by overpopulation.[19] Novelist Brian Herbert, his son and biographer, wrote:\n","\n","Dune is a modern-day conglomeration of familiar myths, a tale in which great sandworms guard a precious treasure of melange, the geriatric spice that represents, among other things, the finite resource of oil. The planet Arrakis features immense, ferocious worms that are like dragons of lore, with \"great teeth\" and a \"bellows breath of cinnamon.\" This resembles the myth described by an unknown English poet in Beowulf, the compelling tale of a fearsome fire dragon who guarded a great treasure hoard in a lair under cliffs, at the edge of the sea. The desert of Frank Herbert’s classic novel is a vast ocean of sand, with giant worms diving into the depths, the mysterious and unrevealed domain of Shai-hulud. Dune tops are like the crests of waves, and there are powerful sandstorms out there, creating extreme danger. On Arrakis, life is said to emanate from the Maker (Shai-hulud) in the desert-sea; similarly all life on Earth is believed to have evolved from our oceans. Frank Herbert drew parallels, used spectacular metaphors, and extrapolated present conditions into world systems that seem entirely alien at first blush. But close examination reveals they aren’t so different from systems we know … and the book characters of his imagination are not so different from people familiar to us.[20]\n","Each chapter of Dune begins with an epigraph excerpted from the fictional writings of the character Princess Irulan. In forms such as diary entries, historical commentary, biography, quotations and philosophy, these writings set tone and provide exposition, context and other details intended to enhance understanding of Herbert's complex fictional universe and themes.[21][22][23] They act as foreshadowing and invite the reader to keep reading to close the gap between what the epigraph says and what is happening in the main narrative.[24] The epigraphs also give the reader the feeling that the world they are reading about is epically distanced, since Irulan writes about an idealized image of Paul as if he had already passed into memory.[25] Brian Herbert wrote: \"Dad told me that you could follow any of the novel's layers as you read it, and then start the book all over again, focusing on an entirely different layer. At the end of the book, he intentionally left loose ends and said he did this to send the readers spinning out of the story with bits and pieces of it still clinging to them, so that they would want to go back and read it again.\"[26]\n","\n","Due to the similarities between some of Herbert's terms and ideas and actual words and concepts in the Arabic language, as well as the series' \"Islamic undertones\" and themes, a Middle-Eastern influence on Herbert's works has been noted repeatedly.[27][28] In his descriptions of the Fremen culture and language, Herbert uses both authentic Arabic words and Arabic-sounding words.[29][30] For example, one of the names for the sandworm, Shai-hulud, is derived from Arabic: شيء خلود, romanized: šayʾ ḫulūd, lit. 'immortal thing' or Arabic: شيخ خلود, romanized: šayḫ ḫulūd, lit. 'old man of eternity'.[31][30] The title of the Fremen housekeeper, the Shadout Mapes, is borrowed from the Arabic: شادوف‎, romanized: šādūf, the Egyptian term for a device used to raise water.[30] In particular, words related to the messianic religion of the Fremen, first implanted by the Bene Gesserit, are taken from Arabic, including Muad'Dib (from Arabic: مؤدب, romanized: muʾaddib, lit. 'educator'), Usul (from Arabic: أصول, romanized: ʾuṣūl, lit. 'fundamental principles'), Shari-a (from Arabic: شريعة, romanized: šarīʿa, lit. 'sharia; path'), Shaitan (from Arabic: شيطان, romanized: šayṭān, lit. 'Shaitan; devil; fiend', and jinn (from Arabic: جن, romanized: ǧinn, lit. 'jinn; spirit; demon; mythical being').[27] It is likely Herbert relied on second-hand resources such as phrasebooks and desert adventure stories to find these Arabic words and phrases for the Fremen.[30] They are meaningful and carefully chosen, and help create an \"imagined desert culture that resonates with exotic sounds, enigmas, and pseudo-Islamic references\" and has a distinctly Bedouin aesthetic.[30]\n","\n","As a foreigner who adopts the ways of a desert-dwelling people and then leads them in a military capacity, Paul Atreides bears many similarities to the historical T. E. Lawrence.[32] His 1962 biopic Lawrence of Arabia has also been identified as a potential influence.[33] The Sabres of Paradise (1960) has also been identified as a potential influence upon Dune, with its depiction of Imam Shamil and the Islamic culture of the Caucasus inspiring some of the themes, characters, events and terminology of Dune.[6]\n","\n","The environment of the desert planet Arrakis was primarily inspired by the environments of the Middle East. Similarly Arrakis as a bioregion is presented as a particular kind of political site. Herbert has made it resemble a desertified petrostate area.[34] The Fremen people of Arrakis were influenced by the Bedouin tribes of Arabia, and the Mahdi prophecy originates from Islamic eschatology.[35] Inspiration is also adopted from medieval historian Ibn Khaldun's cyclical history and his dynastic concept in North Africa, hinted at by Herbert's reference to Khaldun's book Kitāb al-ʿibar (\"The Book of Lessons\"). The fictionalized version of the \"Kitab al-ibar\" in Dune is a combination of a Fremen religious manual and a desert survival book.[36][37]\n","\n","In addition to Arabic, Dune derives words and names from a variety of other languages, including Hebrew, Navajo, Latin, Dutch (“Landsraad”), Chakobsa, the Nahuatl language of the Aztecs, Greek, Persian, Sanskrit (“prana bindu”, “prajna”), Russian, Turkish, Finnish, and Old English.[38] Bene Gesserit is derived from the Latin meaning \"it will have been well borne\" symbolizing their doctrine in the story.[39]\n","\n","Through the inspiration from The Sabres of Paradise, there are also allusions to the tsarist-era Russian nobility and Cossacks.[40] Frank Herbert stated that bureaucracy that lasted long enough would become a hereditary nobility, and a significant theme behind the aristocratic families in Dune was \"aristocratic bureaucracy\" which he saw as analogous to the Soviet Union.[41][42]\n","\n","Dune has been called the \"first planetary ecology novel on a grand scale\".[43] Herbert hoped it would be seen as an \"environmental awareness handbook\" and said the title was meant to \"echo the sound of 'doom'\".[44] It was reviewed in the best selling countercultural Whole Earth Catalog in 1968 as a \"rich re-readable fantasy with clear portrayal of the fierce environment it takes to cohere a community”.[45]\n","\n","After the publication of Silent Spring by Rachel Carson in 1962, science fiction writers began treating the subject of ecological change and its consequences. Dune responded in 1965 with its complex descriptions of Arrakis life, from giant sandworms (for whom water is deadly) to smaller, mouse-like life forms adapted to live with limited water. Dune was followed in its creation of complex and unique ecologies by other science fiction books such as A Door into Ocean (1986) and Red Mars (1992).[43] Environmentalists have pointed out that Dune's popularity as a novel depicting a planet as a complex—almost living—thing, in combination with the first images of Earth from space being published in the same time period, strongly influenced environmental movements such as the establishment of the international Earth Day.[46]\n","\n","While the genre of climate fiction was popularized in the 2010s in response to real global climate change, Dune as well as other early science fiction works from authors like J. G. Ballard (The Drowned World) and Kim Stanley Robinson (the Mars trilogy) have retroactively been considered pioneering examples of the genre.[47][48]\n","\n","The Imperium in Dune contains features of various empires in Europe and the near East, including the Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, and Ottoman Empire.[49][31][50] Lorenzo DiTommaso compared Dune's portrayal of the downfall of a galactic empire to Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which argues that Christianity allied with the profligacy of the Roman elite led to the fall of Ancient Rome. In \"The Articulation of Imperial Decadence and Decline in Epic Science Fiction\" (2007), DiTommaso outlines similarities between the two works by highlighting the excesses of the Emperor on his home planet of Kaitain and of the Baron Harkonnen in his palace. The Emperor loses his effectiveness as a ruler through an excess of ceremony and pomp. The hairdressers and attendants he brings with him to Arrakis are even referred to as \"parasites\". The Baron Harkonnen is similarly corrupt and materially indulgent. Gibbon's Decline and Fall partly blames the fall of Rome on the rise of Christianity. Gibbon claimed that this exotic import from a conquered province weakened the soldiers of Rome and left it open to attack. The Emperor's Sardaukar fighters are little match for the Fremen of Dune not only because of the Sardaukar's overconfidence and the fact that Jessica and Paul have trained the Fremen in their battle tactics, but because of the Fremen's capacity for self-sacrifice. The Fremen put the community before themselves in every instance, while the world outside wallows in luxury at the expense of others.[51]\n","\n","The decline and long peace of the Empire sets the stage for revolution and renewal by genetic mixing of successful and unsuccessful groups through war, a process culminating in the Jihad led by Paul Atreides, described by Frank Herbert as depicting \"war as a collective orgasm\" (drawing on Norman Walter's 1950 The Sexual Cycle of Human Warfare),[52][53] themes that would reappear in God Emperor of Dune's Scattering and Leto II's all-female Fish Speaker army.\n","\n","Gender dynamics are complex in Dune.   Within the Fremen sietch communities, women have almost full equality.  They carry weapons and travel in raiding parties with men, fighting when necessary alongside the men.  They can take positions of leadership as a Sayyadina or as a Reverend Mother (if she can survive the ritual of ingesting the Water of Life.)  Both of these sietch religious leaders are routinely consulted by the all-male Council and can have a decisive voice in all matters of sietch life, security and internal politics.  They are also protected by the entire community.  Due to the high mortality rate among their men, women outnumber men in most sietches. Polygamy is common, and sexual relationships are voluntary and consensual; as Stilgar says to Jessica, “women among us are not taken against their will.”  \n","\n","In contrast, the Imperial aristocracy leaves young women of noble birth very little agency. Frequently trained by the Bene Gesserit, they are raised to eventually marry other aristocrats. Marriages between Major and Minor Houses are political tools to forge alliances or heal old feuds; women are given very little say in the matter. Many such marriages are quietly maneuvered by the Bene Gesserit to produce offspring with some genetic characteristics needed by the sisterhood’s human-breeding program. In addition, such highly-placed sisters were in a position to subtly influence their husbands’ actions in ways that could move the politics of the Imperium toward Bene Gesserit goals. \n","\n","The gom jabbar test of humanity is administered by the female Bene Gesserit order but rarely to males.[54] The Bene Gesserit have seemingly mastered the unconscious and can play on the unconscious weaknesses of others using the Voice, yet their breeding program seeks after a male Kwisatz Haderach.[32] Their plan is to produce a male who can “possess complete racial memory, both male and female,” and look into the black hole in the collective unconscious that they fear.[55] A central theme of the book is the connection, in Jessica's son, of this female aspect with his male aspect. This aligns with concepts in Jungian psychology, which features conscious/unconscious and taking/giving roles associated with males and females, as well as the idea of the collective unconscious.[56] Paul's approach to power consistently requires his upbringing under the matriarchal Bene Gesserit, who operate as a long-dominating shadow government behind all of the great houses and their marriages or divisions.[55] He is trained by Jessica in the Bene Gesserit Way, which includes prana-bindu training in nerve and muscle control and precise perception.[57] Paul also receives Mentat training, thus helping prepare him to be a type of androgynous Kwisatz Haderach, a male Reverend Mother.[55]\n","\n","In a Bene Gesserit test early in the book, it is implied that people are generally \"inhuman\" in that they irrationally place desire over self-interest and reason.[citation needed] This applies Herbert's philosophy that humans are not created equal, while equal justice and equal opportunity are higher ideals than mental, physical, or moral equality.[58]\n","\n","I am showing you the superhero syndrome and your own participation in it.\n","Throughout Paul's rise to superhuman status, he follows a plotline common to many stories describing the birth of a hero.[60] He has unfortunate circumstances forced onto him. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale.[61][62] As such, Dune is representative of a general trend beginning in 1960s American science fiction in that it features a character who attains godlike status through scientific means.[63] Eventually, Paul Atreides gains a level of omniscience which allows him to take over the planet and the galaxy, and causes the Fremen of Arrakis to worship him like a god. Author Frank Herbert said in 1979, \"The bottom line of the Dune trilogy is: beware of heroes. Much better  [to] rely on your own judgment, and your own mistakes.\"[64] He wrote in 1985, \"Dune was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.\"[65]\n","\n","Juan A. Prieto-Pablos says Herbert achieves a new typology with Paul's superpowers, differentiating the heroes of Dune from earlier heroes such as Superman, van Vogt's Gilbert Gosseyn and Henry Kuttner's telepaths. Unlike previous superheroes who acquire their powers suddenly and accidentally, Paul's are the result of \"painful and slow personal progress.\" And unlike other superheroes of the 1960s—who are the exception among ordinary people in their respective worlds—Herbert's characters grow their powers through \"the application of mystical philosophies and techniques.\" For Herbert, the ordinary person can develop incredible fighting skills (Fremen, Ginaz swordsmen and Sardaukar) or mental abilities (Bene Gesserit, Mentats, Spacing Guild Navigators).[66]\n","\n","Early in his newspaper career, Herbert was introduced to Zen by two Jungian psychologists, Ralph and Irene Slattery, who \"gave a crucial boost to his thinking\".[67] Zen teachings ultimately had \"a profound and continuing influence on [Herbert's] work\".[67] Throughout the Dune series and particularly in Dune, Herbert employs concepts and forms borrowed from Zen Buddhism.[67][68] The Fremen are Zensunni adherents, and many of Herbert's epigraphs are Zen-spirited.[69] In \"Dune Genesis\", Frank Herbert wrote:\n","\n","What especially pleases me is to see the interwoven themes, the fugue like relationships of images that exactly replay the way Dune took shape. As in an Escher lithograph, I involved myself with recurrent themes that turn into paradox. The central paradox concerns the human vision of time. What about Paul's gift of prescience - the Presbyterian fixation? For the Delphic Oracle to perform, it must tangle itself in a web of predestination. Yet predestination negates surprises and, in fact, sets up a mathematically enclosed universe whose limits are always inconsistent, always encountering the unprovable. It's like a koan, a Zen mind breaker. It's like the Cretan Epimenides saying, \"All Cretans are liars.\"[58]\n","Brian Herbert called the Dune universe \"a spiritual melting pot\", noting that his father incorporated elements of a variety of religions, including Buddhism, Sufi mysticism and other Islamic belief systems, Catholicism, Protestantism, Judaism, and Hinduism.[70] He added that Frank Herbert's fictional future in which \"religious beliefs have combined into interesting forms\" represents the author's solution to eliminating arguments between religions, each of which claimed to have \"the one and only revelation.\"[70][71]\n","\n","Tim O'Reilly suggests that Herbert also wrote Dune as a counterpoint to Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. In his monograph on Frank Herbert, O'Reilly wrote that \"Dune is clearly a commentary on the Foundation trilogy. Herbert has taken a look at the same imaginative situation that provoked Asimov's classic—the decay of a galactic empire—and restated it in a way that draws on different assumptions and suggests radically different conclusions. The twist he has introduced into Dune is that the Mule, not the Foundation, is his hero.\"[72] According to O'Reilly, Herbert bases the Bene Gesserit on the scientific shamans of the Foundation, though they use biological rather than statistical science.[72] In contrast to the Foundation series and its praise of science and rationality, Dune proposes that the unconscious and unexpected are actually what are needed for humanity.[72]\n","\n","However, both works contain a similar theme of the restoration of civilization[73] and seem to make the fundamental assumption that “political maneuvering, the need to control material resources, and friendship or mating bonds will be fundamentally the same in the future as they are now.”[74]\n","\n","Dune tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966[75] and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.[76] Reviews of the novel have been largely positive, and Dune is considered by some critics to be the best science fiction book ever written.[77] The novel has been translated into dozens of languages, and has sold almost 20 million copies.[78] Dune has been regularly cited as one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels.[79][80]\n","\n","Arthur C. Clarke described Dune as \"unique\" and wrote, \"I know nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings.\"[81] Robert A. Heinlein described the novel as \"powerful, convincing, and most ingenious.\"[81][82] It was described as \"one of the monuments of modern science fiction\" by the Chicago Tribune,[81] and P. Schuyler Miller called Dune \"one of the landmarks of modern science fiction ... an amazing feat of creation.\"[82] The Washington Post described it as \"a portrayal of an alien society more complete and deeply detailed than any other author in the field has managed ... a story absorbing equally for its action and philosophical vistas ... An astonishing science fiction phenomenon.\"[81][82] Algis Budrys praised Dune for the vividness of its imagined setting, saying \"The time lives. It breathes, it speaks, and Herbert has smelt it in his nostrils\". He found that the novel, however, \"turns flat and tails off at the end. ... [T]ruly effective villains simply simper and melt; fierce men and cunning statesmen and seeresses all bend before this new Messiah\". Budrys faulted in particular Herbert's decision to kill Paul's infant son offstage, with no apparent emotional impact, saying \"you cannot be so busy saving a world that you cannot hear an infant shriek\".[83] After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed Dune as among stories \"that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical\".[84]\n","\n","The Louisville Times wrote, \"Herbert's creation of this universe, with its intricate development and analysis of ecology, religion, politics, and philosophy, remains one of the supreme and seminal achievements in science fiction.\"[82] Writing for The New Yorker, Jon Michaud praises Herbert's \"clever authorial decision\" to exclude robots and computers (\"two staples of the genre\") from his fictional universe, but suggests that this may be one explanation why Dune lacks \"true fandom among science-fiction fans\" to the extent that it \"has not penetrated popular culture in the way that The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars have\".[12] Tamara I. Hladik wrote that the story \"crafts a universe where lesser novels promulgate excuses for sequels. All its rich elements are in balance and plausible—not the patchwork confederacy of made-up languages, contrived customs, and meaningless histories that are the hallmark of so many other, lesser novels.\"[85]\n","\n","On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Dune on its list of the 100 most influential novels.[86]\n","\n","J. R. R. Tolkien refused to review Dune, on the grounds that he disliked it \"with some intensity\" and thus felt it would be unfair to Herbert, another working author, if he gave an honest review of the book.[87]\n","\n","The first edition of Dune is one of the most valuable in science fiction book collecting. Copies have been sold for more than $10,000 at auction.[88] The Chilton first edition of the novel is .mw-parser-output .frac{white-space:nowrap}.mw-parser-output .frac .num,.mw-parser-output .frac .den{font-size:80%;line-height:0;vertical-align:super}.mw-parser-output .frac .den{vertical-align:sub}.mw-parser-output .sr-only{border:0;clip:rect(0,0,0,0);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;width:1px}9+1⁄4 inches (235 mm) tall, with bluish green boards and a price of $5.95 on the dust jacket, and notes Toronto as the Canadian publisher on the copyright page. Up to this point, Chilton had been publishing only automobile repair manuals.[89]\n","\n","California State University, Fullerton's Pollack Library has several of Herbert's draft manuscripts of Dune and other works, with the author's notes, in their Frank Herbert Archives.[90]\n","\n","After Dune proved to be a critical and financial success for Herbert, he was able to devote himself full time to writing additional novels in the series. He had already drafted parts of the second and third while writing Dune.[12] The series included Dune Messiah (1969), Children of Dune (1976), God Emperor of Dune (1981), Heretics of Dune (1984), and Chapterhouse: Dune (1985), each sequentially continuing on the narrative from Dune. Herbert died on February 11, 1986.[91]\n","\n","Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, had found several thousand pages of notes left by his father that outlined ideas for other narratives related to Dune. Brian Herbert enlisted author Kevin J. Anderson to help build out prequel novels to the events of Dune. Brian Herbert's and Anderson's Dune prequels first started publication in 1999, and have led to additional stories that take place between those of Frank Herbert's books.[92] The notes for what would have been Dune 7 also enabled them to publish Hunters of Dune (2006) and Sandworms of Dune (2007), sequels to Frank Herbert's final novel Chapterhouse: Dune, which complete the chronological progression of his original series, and wrap up storylines that began in Heretics of Dune.\n","\n","Dune has been considered as an \"unfilmable\" and \"uncontainable\" work to adapt from novel to film or other visual medium.[93] Described by Wired, \"It has four appendices and a glossary of its own gibberish, and its action takes place on two planets, one of which is a desert overrun by worms the size of airport runways. Lots of important people die or try to kill each other, and they're all tethered to about eight entangled subplots.\"[94] There have been several attempts to achieve this difficult conversion with various degrees of success.[95]\n","\n","In 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by Arthur P. Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune. As Jacobs was busy with other projects, such as the sequel to Planet of the Apes, Dune was delayed for another year. Jacobs' first choice for director was David Lean, but he turned down the offer. Charles Jarrott was also considered to direct. Work was also under way on a script while the hunt for a director continued. Initially, the first treatment had been handled by Robert Greenhut, the producer who had lobbied Jacobs to make the movie in the first place, but subsequently Rospo Pallenberg was approached to write the script, with shooting scheduled to begin in 1974. However, Jacobs died in 1973.[96]\n","\n","In December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights from APJ, with Alejandro Jodorowsky set to direct.[97] In 1975, Jodorowsky planned to film the story as a 10-hour feature, set to star his own son Brontis Jodorowsky in the lead role of Paul Atreides, Salvador Dalí as Shaddam IV, Padishah Emperor, Amanda Lear as Princess Irulan, Orson Welles as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, Gloria Swanson as Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, David Carradine as Duke Leto Atreides, Geraldine Chaplin as Lady Jessica, Alain Delon as Duncan Idaho, Hervé Villechaize as Gurney Halleck, Udo Kier as Piter De Vries, and Mick Jagger as Feyd-Rautha. It was at first proposed to score the film with original music by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Henry Cow, and Magma; later on, the soundtrack was to be provided by Pink Floyd.[98] Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting of Chris Foss, a British artist who designed covers for science fiction periodicals, Jean Giraud (Moebius), a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for Metal Hurlant magazine, and H. R. Giger.[97] Moebius began designing creatures and characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to design the film's space ships and hardware.[97] Giger began designing the Harkonnen Castle based on Moebius's storyboards. Dan O'Bannon was to head the special effects department.[97]\n","\n","Dalí was cast as the Emperor.[97] Dalí later demanded to be paid $100,000 per hour; Jodorowsky agreed, but tailored Dalí's part to be filmed in one hour, drafting plans for other scenes of the emperor to use a mechanical mannequin as substitute for Dalí.[97] According to Giger, Dalí was \"later invited to leave the film because of his pro-Franco statements\".[99] Just as the storyboards, designs, and script were finished, the financial backing dried up. Frank Herbert traveled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky's script would result in a 14-hour movie (\"It was the size of a phone book\", Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. Jodorowsky said in 1985 that he found the Dune story mythical and had intended to recreate it rather than adapt the novel; though he had an \"enthusiastic admiration\" for Herbert, Jodorowsky said he had done everything possible to distance the author and his input from the project.[97] Although Jodorowsky was embittered by the experience, he said the Dune project changed his life, and some of the ideas were used in his and Moebius's The Incal.[100] O'Bannon entered a psychiatric hospital after the production failed, then worked on 13 scripts, the last of which became Alien.[97] A 2013 documentary, Jodorowsky's Dune, was made about Jodorowsky's failed attempt at an adaptation.\n","\n","In 1976, Dino De Laurentiis acquired the rights from Gibon's consortium. De Laurentiis commissioned Herbert to write a new screenplay in 1978; the script Herbert turned in was 175 pages long, the equivalent of nearly three hours of screen time. De Laurentiis then hired director Ridley Scott in 1979, with Rudy Wurlitzer writing the screenplay and H. R. Giger retained from the Jodorowsky production; Scott and Giger had also just worked together on the film Alien, after O'Bannon recommended the artist.[101][102] Scott intended to split the novel into two movies. He worked on three drafts of the script, using The Battle of Algiers as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science fiction film, Blade Runner (1982). As he recalls, the pre-production process was slow, and finishing the project would have been even more time-intensive:\n","\n","But after seven months I dropped out of Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer had come up with a first-draft script which I felt was a decent distillation of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was going to take a lot more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. Frankly, that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.\n","\n","In 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. De Laurentiis re-negotiated the rights from the author, adding to them the rights to the Dune sequels (written and unwritten). After seeing The Elephant Man, De Laurentiis' daughter Raffaella decided that David Lynch should direct the movie. Around that time Lynch received several other directing offers, including Return of the Jedi. He agreed to direct Dune and write the screenplay even though he had not read the book, was not familiar with the story, or even been interested in science fiction.[103] Lynch worked on the script for six months with Eric Bergren and Christopher De Vore. The team yielded two drafts of the script before it split over creative differences. Lynch would subsequently work on five more drafts. Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film's timeline.[104] Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour long film, but at demands from Universal Pictures, the film's distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage.[105]\n","\n","This first film of Dune, directed by Lynch, was released in 1984, nearly 20 years after the book's publication. Though Herbert said the book's depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he was pleased with the film, saying that \"They've got it. It begins as Dune does. And I hear my dialogue all the way through. There are some interpretations and liberties, but you're gonna come out knowing you've seen Dune.\"[106] Reviews of the film were negative, saying that it was incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book's plot.[107][108][109][93][110] Upon release for television and other forms of home media, Universal opted to reintroduce much of the footage that Lynch had cut, creating an over-three-hour long version with extensive monologue exposition. Lynch was extremely displeased with this move, and demanded that Universal replace his name on these cuts with the pseudonym \"Alan Smithee\", and has generally distanced himself from the film since.[105]\n","\n","In 2000, John Harrison adapted the novel into Frank Herbert's Dune, a miniseries which premiered on American Sci-Fi Channel.[15] As of 2004, the miniseries was one of the three highest-rated programs broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel.[111]\n","\n","In 2008, Paramount Pictures announced that they would produce a new film based on the book, with Peter Berg attached to direct.[112] Producer Kevin Misher, who spent a year securing the rights from the Herbert estate, was to be joined by Richard Rubinstein and John Harrison (of both Sci Fi Channel miniseries) as well as Sarah Aubrey and Mike Messina.[112] The producers stated that they were going for a \"faithful adaptation\" of the novel, and considered \"its theme of finite ecological resources particularly timely.\"[112] Science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson and Frank Herbert's son Brian Herbert, who had together written multiple Dune sequels and prequels since 1999, were attached to the project as technical advisors.[113] In October 2009, Berg dropped out of the project, later saying that it \"for a variety of reasons wasn't the right thing\" for him.[114] Subsequently, with a script draft by Joshua Zetumer, Paramount reportedly sought a new director who could do the film for under $175 million.[115] In 2010, Pierre Morel was signed on to direct, with screenwriter Chase Palmer incorporating Morel's vision of the project into Zetumer's original draft.[116][117] By November 2010, Morel left the project.[118] Paramount finally dropped plans for a remake in March 2011.[119]\n","\n","In November 2016, Legendary Entertainment acquired the film and TV rights for Dune.[120][121] Variety reported in December 2016 that Denis Villeneuve was in negotiations to direct the project,[122] which was confirmed in February 2017.[123] In April 2017, Legendary announced that Eric Roth would write the screenplay.[124] Villeneuve explained in March 2018 that his adaptation will be split into two films, with the first installment scheduled to begin production in 2019.[125] Casting includes Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides,[126] Dave Bautista as Rabban, Stellan Skarsgård as Baron Harkonnen,[127] Rebecca Ferguson as Lady Jessica,[128] Charlotte Rampling as Reverend Mother Mohiam,[129] Oscar Isaac as Duke Leto Atreides,[130] Zendaya as Chani,[131] Javier Bardem as Stilgar,[132] Josh Brolin as Gurney Halleck,[133] Jason Momoa as Duncan Idaho,[134] David Dastmalchian as Piter De Vries,[135] Chang Chen as Dr. Yueh,[136] and Stephen Henderson as Thufir Hawat.[137] Warner Bros. Pictures distributed the film, which had its initial premiere on September 3, 2021, at the Venice Film Festival,[138] and wide release in both theaters and streaming on HBO Max on October 21, 2021, as part of Warner Bros.'s approach to handling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry.[139][140] The film received \"generally favorable reviews\" on Metacritic.[141] It has gone on to win multiple awards and was named by the National Board of Review as one of the 10 best films of 2021, as well as the American Film Institute in their annual top 10 list.[142] The film went on to be nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning six, the most wins of the night for any film in contention.[143]\n","\n","A sequel, Dune: Part Two, is scheduled for release in October 2023.[144]\n","\n","In 1993, Recorded Books Inc. released a 20-disc audiobook narrated by George Guidall.

Such systems are often viewed as\n","software components for constructing real-world NLP solutions.\n","The overwhelming majority of these state-of-the-art systems address their single benchmark\n","task by applying linear statistical models to ad-hoc features. In other words, the researchers them-\n","selves discover intermediate representations by engineering task-speciﬁc features. These features\n","are often derived from the output of preexisting systems, leading to complex runtime dependencies.\n","This approach is effective because researchers leverage a large body of linguistic knowledge.

Until such fundamental\n","Articial Intelligence problems are resolved, computer scientists must settle for the reduced objective\n","of extracting simpler representations that describe limited aspects of the textual information.\n","These simpler representations are often motivated by speciﬁc applications (for instance, bag-\n","of-words variants for information retrieval), or by our belief that they capture something more gen-\n","eral about natural language. They can describe syntactic information (e.g., part-of-speech tagging,\n","chunking, and parsing) or semantic information (e.g., word-sense disambiguation, semantic role\n","labeling, named entity extraction, and anaphora resolution). Text corpora have been manually an-\n","notated with such data structures in order to compare the performance of various systems.

Such systems are often viewed as\n","software components for constructing real-world NLP solutions.\n","The overwhelming majority of these state-of-the-art systems address their single benchmark\n","task by applying linear statistical models to ad-hoc features. In other words, the researchers them-\n","selves discover intermediate representations by engineering task-speciﬁc features. These features\n","are often derived from the output of preexisting systems, leading to complex runtime dependencies.\n","This approach is effective because researchers leverage a large body of linguistic knowledge. On\n","the other hand, there is a great temptation to optimize the performance of a system for a speciﬁc\n","benchmark. Although such performance improvements can be very useful in practice, they teach us\n","little about the means to progress toward the broader goals of natural language understanding and\n","the elusive goals of Artiﬁcial Intelligence.\n","In this contribution, we try to excel on multiple benchmarks while avoiding task-speciﬁc engi-\n","neering. Instead we use a single learning system able to discover adequate internal representations.\n","In fact we view the benchmarks as indirect measurements of the relevance of the internal represen-\n","tations discovered by the learning procedure, and we posit that these intermediate representations\n","are more general than any of the benchmarks.

Each word is assigned only one unique tag, often\n","encoded as a begin-chunk (e.g., B-NP) or inside-chunk tag (e.g., I-NP). Chunking is often evaluated\n","using the CoNLL 2000 shared task.1 Sections 15–18 of WSJ data are used for training and section\n","20 for testing. Validation is achieved by splitting the training set.\n","Kudoh and Matsumoto (2000) won the CoNLL 2000 challenge on chunking with a F1-score\n","of 93.48%. Their system was based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Each SVM was trained\n","in a pairwise classiﬁcation manner, and fed with a window around the word of interest containing\n","POS and words as features, as well as surrounding tags. They perform dynamic programming at\n","test time. Later, they improved their results up to 93.91% (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) using an\n","ensemble of classiﬁers trained with different tagging conventions (see Section 3.3.3).\n","Since then, a certain number of systems based on second-order random ﬁelds were reported\n","(Sha and Pereira, 2003; McDonald et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2008), all reporting around 94.3% F1\n","score. These systems use features composed of words, POS tags, and tags.\n","More recently, Shen and Sarkar (2005) obtained 95.23% using a voting classiﬁer scheme, where\n","each classiﬁer is trained on different tag representations2 (IOB, IOE, . . . ). They use POS features\n","coming from an external tagger, as well carefully hand-crafted specialization features which again\n","change the data representation by concatenating some (carefully chosen) chunk tags or some words\n","with their POS representation. They then build trigrams over these features, which are ﬁnally passed\n","through a Viterbi decoder a test time.\n","2.3 Named Entity Recognition\n","NER labels atomic elements in the sentence into categories such as “PERSON” or “LOCATION”.\n","As in the chunking task, each word is assigned a tag preﬁxed by an indicator of the beginning or the\n","inside of an entity. The CoNLL 2003 setup3 is a NER benchmark data set based on Reuters data.\n","The contest provides training, validation and testing sets.\n","Florian et al. (2003) presented the best system at the NER CoNLL 2003 challenge, with 88.76%\n","F1 score. They used a combination of various machine-learning classiﬁers. Features they picked\n","included words, POS tags, CHUNK tags, preﬁxes and sufﬁxes, a large gazetteer (not provided by\n","the challenge), as well as the output of two other NER classiﬁers trained on richer data sets. Chieu\n","(2003), the second best performer of CoNLL 2003 (88.31% F1), also used an external gazetteer\n","(their performance goes down to 86.84% with no gazetteer) and several hand-chosen features.\n","Later, Ando and Zhang (2005) reached 89.31% F1 with a semi-supervised approach. They\n","trained jointly a linear model on NER with a linear model on two auxiliary unsupervised tasks.\n","They also performed Viterbi decoding at test time. The unlabeled corpus was 27M words taken\n","from Reuters. Features included words, POS tags, sufﬁxes and preﬁxes or CHUNK tags, but overall\n","were less specialized than CoNLL 2003 challengers.\n","1. See http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2000/chunking.\n","2.

In the PropBank\n","(Palmer et al., 2005) formalism one assigns roles ARG0-5 to words that are arguments of a verb\n","(or more technically, a predicate) in the sentence, for example, the following sentence might be\n","tagged “[John] [ate] [the apple] ”, where “ate” is the predicate. The precise arguments\n","ARG0 REL ARG1\n","depend on a verb’s frame and if there are multiple verbs in a sentence some words might have multi-\n","ple tags. In addition to the ARG0-5 tags, there there are several modiﬁer tags such as ARGM-LOC\n","(locational) and ARGM-TMP (temporal) that operate in a similar way for all verbs. We picked\n","CoNLL 20054 as our SRL benchmark. It takes sections 2–21 of WSJ data as training set, and sec-\n","tion 24 as validation set. A test set composed of section 23 of WSJ concatenated with 3 sections\n","from the Brown corpus is also provided by the challenge.\n","State-of-the-art SRL systems consist of several stages: producing a parse tree, identifying which\n","parse tree nodes represent the arguments of a given verb, and ﬁnally classifying these nodes to\n","compute the corresponding SRL tags. This entails extracting numerous base features from the parse\n","tree and feeding them into statistical models. Feature categories commonly used by these system\n","include (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004):\n","• the parts of speech and syntactic labels of words and nodes in the tree;\n","• the node’s position (left or right) in relation to the verb;\n","• the syntactic path to the verb in the parse tree;\n","• whether a node in the parse tree is part of a noun or verb phrase;\n","• the voice of the sentence: active or passive;\n","• the node’s head word; and\n","• the verb sub-categorization.\n","Pradhan et al. (2004) take these base features and deﬁne additional features, notably the part-of-\n","speech tag of the head word, the predicted named entity class of the argument, features providing\n","word sense disambiguation for the verb (they add 25 variants of 12 new feature types overall). This\n","system is close to the state-of-the-art in performance. Pradhan et al. (2005) obtain 77.30% F1 with a\n","system based on SVM classiﬁers and simultaneously using the two parse trees provided for the SRL\n","task. In the same spirit, Haghighi et al. (2005) use log-linear models on each tree node, re-ranked\n","globally with a dynamic algorithm. Their system reaches 77.04% using the ﬁve top Charniak parse\n","trees.\n","Koomen et al. (2005) hold the state-of-the-art with Winnow-like (Littlestone, 1988) classiﬁers,\n","followed by a decoding stage based on an integer program that enforces speciﬁc constraints on SRL\n","tags. They reach 77.92% F1 on CoNLL 2005, thanks to the ﬁve top parse trees produced by the\n","Charniak (2000) parser (only the ﬁrst one was provided by the contest) as well as the Collins (1999)\n","parse tree.\n","4.

In particular, we chose the hyper-parameters of our model\n","according to a simple validation procedure (see Remark 8 later in Section 3.5), performed over the\n","validation set available for each task (see Section 2). All these three tasks are evaluated by comput-\n","ing the F1 scores over chunks produced by our models. The POS task is evaluated by computing\n","the per-word accuracy, as it is the case for the standard benchmark we refer to (Toutanova et al.,\n","2003). We used the conlleval script5 for evaluating POS,6 NER and CHUNK. For SRL, we used\n","the srl-eval.pl script included in the srlconll package.7\n","2.6 Discussion\n","When participating in an (open) challenge, it is legitimate to increase generalization by all means.\n","It is thus not surprising to see many top CoNLL systems using external labeled data, like additional\n","NER classiﬁers for the NER architecture of Florian et al. (2003) or additional parse trees for SRL\n","systems (Koomen et al., 2005). Combining multiple systems or tweaking carefully features is also\n","a common approach, like in the chunking top system (Shen and Sarkar, 2005).\n","However, when comparing systems, we do not learn anything of the quality of each system if\n","they were trained with different labeled data. For that reason, we will refer to benchmark systems,\n","that is, top existing systems which avoid usage of external data and have been well-established in\n","the NLP ﬁeld: Toutanova et al. (2003) for POS and Sha and Pereira (2003) for chunking. For NER\n","we consider Ando and Zhang (2005) as they were using additional unlabeled data only. We picked\n","Koomen et al. (2005) for SRL, keeping in mind they use 4 additional parse trees not provided by\n","the challenge. These benchmark systems will serve as baseline references in our experiments. We\n","marked them in bold in Table 2.\n","We note that for the four tasks we are considering in this work, it can be seen that for the\n","more complex tasks (with corresponding lower accuracies), the best systems proposed have more\n","engineered features relative to the best systems on the simpler tasks. That is, the POS task is one of\n","the simplest of our four tasks, and only has relatively few engineered features, whereas SRL is the\n","most complex, and many kinds of features have been designed for it. This clearly has implications\n","for as yet unsolved NLP tasks requiring more sophisticated semantic understanding than the ones\n","considered here.\n","3. The Networks\n","All the NLP tasks above can be seen as tasks assigning labels to words. The traditional NLP ap-\n","proach is: extract from the sentence a rich set of hand-designed features which are then fed to a\n","standard classiﬁcation algorithm, for example, a Support Vector Machine (SVM), often with a lin-\n","ear kernel. The choice of features is a completely empirical process, mainly based ﬁrst on linguistic\n","intuition, and then trial and error, and the feature selection is task dependent, implying additional\n","research for each new NLP task.

For efﬁciency, words are fed to our architecture as indices taken from a ﬁnite dictionary\n","D.\n","Obviously, a simple index does not carry much useful information about the word. However,\n","the ﬁrst layer of our network maps each of these word indices into a feature vector, by a lookup\n","table operation. Given a task of interest, a relevant representation of each word is then given by\n","the corresponding lookup table feature vector, which is trained by backpropagation, starting from\n","a random initialization.9 We will see in Section 4 that we can learn very good word representa-\n","tions from unlabeled corpora. Our architecture allow us to take advantage of better trained word\n","representations, by simply initializing the word lookup table with these representations (instead of\n","randomly).\n","D\n","More formally, for each word w ∈ , an internal d -dimensional feature vector representation\n","wrd\n","is given by the lookup table layer LT (·):\n","W\n","LT (w) = hW i1 ,\n","W w\n","where W ∈ Rdwrd×|D| is a matrix of parameters to be learned, hW i1 ∈ Rdwrd is the wth column of W\n","w\n","and d is the word vector size (a hyper-parameter to be chosen by the user).

For example, for the NER task, one could provide a feature which says if a\n","word is in a gazetteer or not. Another common practice is to introduce some basic pre-processing,\n","such as word-stemming or dealing with upper and lower case. In this latter option, the word would\n","be then represented by three discrete features: its lower case stemmed root, its lower case ending,\n","and a capitalization feature.\n","D1\n","Generally speaking, we can consider a word as represented by K discrete features w ∈ ×\n","· · · × DK, where Dk is the dictionary for the kth feature. We associate to each feature a lookup table\n","LTWk (·), with parameters W k ∈ Rdwkrd×|Dk| where dwkrd ∈ N is a user-speciﬁed vector size. Given a\n","8.

Producing tags for\n","each element in variable length sequences (here, a sentence is a sequence of words) is a standard\n","problem in machine-learning. We consider two common approaches which tag one word at the\n","time: a window approach, and a (convolutional) sentence approach.\n","3.3.1 WINDOW APPROACH\n","A window approach assumes the tag of a word depends mainly on its neighboring words. Given a\n","word to tag, we consider a ﬁxed size k (a hyper-parameter) window of words around this word.\n","sz\n","Each word in the window is ﬁrst passed through the lookup table layer (1) or (2), producing a matrix\n","of word features of ﬁxed size d × k . This matrix can be viewed as a d k -dimensional vector\n","wrd sz wrd sz\n","by concatenating each column vector, which can be fed to further neural network layers. More\n","formally, the word feature window given by the ﬁrst network layer can be written as:\n","hW i1[w]t−dwin/2..\n"," . \n","fq 1 = hLTW ([w]T1 )itdwin = hW i1[w] .

The hyper-parameter nl is\n","hu\n","usually called the number of hidden units of the lth layer.\n","2502  \n","\n","NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (ALMOST) FROM SCRATCH\n","HardTanh Layer. Several linear layers are often stacked, interleaved with a non-linearity func-\n","tion, to extract highly non-linear features. If no non-linearity is introduced, our network would be a\n","simple linear model. We chose a “hard” version of the hyperbolic tangent as non-linearity. It has the\n","advantage of being slightly cheaper to compute (compared to the exact hyperbolic tangent), while\n","leaving the generalization performance unchanged (Collobert, 2004). The corresponding layer l\n","applies a HardTanh over its input vector:\n","f l = HardTanh( f l−1 ) ,\n","q q\n","i i\n","h i h i\n","where\n","−1 if x < −1\n","HardTanh(x) = x if − 1 <= x <= 1 . (5)\n","\n","1 if x > 1\n","\n","Scoring. Finally, the output size of the last layer L of our network is equal to the number\n","of possible tags for the task of interest. Each output can be then interpreted as a score of the\n","corresponding tag (given the input of the network), thanks to a carefully chosen cost function that\n","we will describe later in this section.\n","Remark 1 (Border Effects) The feature window (3) is not well deﬁned for words near the begin-\n","ning or the end of a sentence. To circumvent this problem, we augment the sentence with a special\n","“PADDING” word replicated d /2 times at the beginning and the end. This is akin to the use of\n","win\n","“start” and “stop” symbols in sequence models.\n","3.3.2 SENTENCE APPROACH\n","We will see in the experimental section that a window approach performs well for most natural\n","language processing tasks we are interested in. However this approach fails with SRL, where the tag\n","of a word depends on a verb (or, more correctly, predicate) chosen beforehand in the sentence. If the\n","verb falls outside the window, one cannot expect this word to be tagged correctly. In this particular\n","case, tagging a word requires the consideration of the whole sentence. When using neural networks,\n","the natural choice to tackle this problem becomes a convolutional approach, ﬁrst introduced by\n","Waibel et al. (1989) and also called Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs) in the literature.\n","We describe in detail our convolutional network below. It successively takes the complete sen-\n","tence, passes it through the lookup table layer (1), produces local features around each word of the\n","sentence thanks to convolutional layers, combines these feature into a global feature vector which\n","can then be fed to standard afﬁne layers (4). In the semantic role labeling case, this operation is\n","performed for each word in the sentence, and for each verb in the sentence. It is thus necessary to\n","encode in the network architecture which verb we are considering in the sentence, and which word\n","we want to tag. For that purpose, each word at position i in the sentence is augmented with two\n","features in the way described in Section 3.2.1. These features encode the relative distances i − posv\n","and i − pos with respect to the chosen verb at position pos , and the word to tag at position pos\n","w v w\n","respectively.\n","Convolutional Layer. A convolutional layer can be seen as a generalization of a window ap-\n","proach: given a sequence represented by columns in a matrix f l−1 (in our lookup table matrix (1)),\n","q\n","a matrix-vector operation as in (4) is applied to each window of successive windows in the sequence.\n","2503  \n","\n","COLLOBERT, WESTON, BOTTOU, KARLEN, KAVUKCUOGLU AND KUKSA\n","70 70\n","x\n","60 x 60 xxxx\n","50 xxx 50 xxxx\n","xxx xxxx\n","40 40\n","xxx xx xxxx\n","30 xxxx 30 xx x xxxx\n","20 xxxxxx xx 20 xxxx xxxx\n","xxxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxxx\n","10 10\n","xxxxxxxxxxxxxx x xxxxxx xxxxx\n","0 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xx 0 xx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n","xThxxeprxopcoxhsaendgaxelssoxwouxxldalloxxwexxxecutotxivesrxeporextxerxcoisfesxxoptxxionlastxxeranxdlexssxoftenxx.x xThxxeprxopocsxheadngaxelssoxwouxxldalloxxwexxxecutotxivesrxeporextxerxcoisfesxxoptxxionlastxxeranxdlexssxoftenxx.x\n","Figure 3: Number of features chosen at each word position by the Max layer.

By applying a Max over the sentence, we ob-\n","tain 300 features for the whole sentence. It is interesting to see that the network catches\n","features mostly around the verb of interest (here “report”) and word of interest (“pro-\n","posed” (left) or “often” (right)).\n","Using previous notations, the tth output column of the lth layer can be computed as:\n","h f l i1 = W l h f l−1idwin + bl ∀t , (6)\n","q t q t\n","where the weight matrix W l is the same across all windows t in the sequence. Convolutional layers\n","extract local features around each window of the given sequence. As for standard afﬁne layers (4),\n","convolutional layers are often stacked to extract higher level features. In this case, each layer must\n","be followed by a non-linearity (5) or the network would be equivalent to one convolutional layer.\n","Max Layer. The size of the output (6) depends on the number of words in the sentence fed\n","to the network. Local feature vectors extracted by the convolutional layers have to be combined\n","to obtain a global feature vector, with a ﬁxed size independent of the sentence length, in order to\n","apply subsequent standard afﬁne layers. Traditional convolutional networks often apply an average\n","(possibly weighted) or a max operation over the “time” t of the sequence (6). (Here, “time” just\n","means the position in the sentence, this term stems from the use of convolutional layers in, for\n","example, speech data where the sequence occurs over time.) The average operation does not make\n","much sense in our case, as in general most words in the sentence do not have any inﬂuence on the\n","semantic role of a given word to tag. Instead, we used a max approach, which forces the network to\n","capture the most useful local features produced by the convolutional layers (see Figure 3), for the\n","task at hand. Given a matrix f l−1 output by a convolutional layer l − 1, the Max layer l outputs a\n","q\n","vector f l :\n","q\n","f l = max f l−1 1 ≤ i ≤ nl−1 .

In the window approach, these tags apply to the word located in the center of the window.\n","In the (convolutional) sentence approach, these tags apply to the word designated by additional\n","markers in the network input.\n","The POS task indeed consists of marking the syntactic role of each word. However, the re-\n","maining three tasks associate labels with segments of a sentence. This is usually achieved by using\n","special tagging schemes to identify the segment boundaries, as shown in Table 3. Several such\n","schemes have been deﬁned (IOB, IOE, IOBES, . . . ) without clear conclusion as to which scheme\n","is better in general. State-of-the-art performance is sometimes obtained by combining classiﬁers\n","trained with different tagging schemes (e.g., Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001).\n","The ground truth for the NER, CHUNK, and SRL tasks is provided using two different tagging\n","schemes. In order to eliminate this additional source of variations, we have decided to use the most\n","expressive IOBES tagging scheme for all tasks. For instance, in the CHUNK task, we describe\n","noun phrases using four different tags. Tag “S-NP” is used to mark a noun phrase containing a\n","single word. Otherwise tags “B-NP”, “I-NP”, and “E-NP” are used to mark the ﬁrst, intermediate\n","and last words of the noun phrase. An additional tag “O” marks words that are not members of a\n","chunk. During testing, these tags are then converted to the original IOB tagging scheme and fed to\n","the standard performance evaluation scripts mentioned in Section 2.5.\n","3.4 Training\n","All our neural networks are trained by maximizing a likelihood over the training data, using stochas-\n","tic gradient ascent. If we denote q to be all the trainable parameters of the network, which are trained\n","using a training set T we want to maximize the following log-likelihood with respect to q :\n","q 7→ (cid:229) log p(y | x, q ) , (8)\n","(x,y)∈T\n","where x corresponds to either a training word window or a sentence and its associated features, and\n","y represents the corresponding tag.

Training\n","using a word-level approach discards this kind of labeling information. We consider a training\n","scheme which takes into account the sentence structure: given the predictions of all tags by our\n","network for all words in a sentence, and given a score for going from one tag to another tag, we\n","want to encourage valid paths of tags during training, while discouraging all other paths.\n","We consider the matrix of scores f ([x]T ) output by the network. As before, we drop the input\n","q 1\n","[x]T for notation simpliﬁcation. The element f of the matrix is the score output by the network\n","1 q i,t\n","with parameters q , for the sentence [x]T and for the ith tag, at the tth word.

More importantly for\n","us, neither work leads to signiﬁcant word embeddings being reported.\n","Shannon (1951) has estimated the entropy of the English language between 0.6 and 1.3 bits per\n","character by asking human subjects to guess upcoming characters. Cover and King (1978) give\n","a lower bound of 1.25 bits per character using a subtle gambling approach. Meanwhile, using a\n","simple word trigram model, Brown et al. (1992b) reach 1.75 bits per character. Teahan and Cleary\n","(1996) obtain entropies as low as 1.46 bits per character using variable length character n-grams.\n","The human subjects rely of course on all their knowledge of the language and of the world. Can we\n","learn the grammatical structure of the English language and the nature of the world by leveraging\n","the 0.2 bits per character that separate human subjects from simple n-gram models? Since such tasks\n","certainly require high capacity models, obtaining sufﬁciently small conﬁdence intervals on the test\n","set entropy may require prohibitively large training sets.16 The entropy criterion lacks dynamical\n","range because its numerical value is largely determined by the most frequent phrases. In order to\n","learn syntax, rare but legal phrases are no less signiﬁcant than common phrases.\n","It is therefore desirable to deﬁne alternative training criteria.

However, in our case, we do not want to emphasize the most common phrase over the rare\n","but legal phrases. Therefore we use a simple pairwise criterion.\n","We consider a window approach network, as described in Section 3.3.1 and Figure 1, with\n","parameters q which outputs a score f (x) given a window of text x = [w]dwin.

However, Klein and Manning (2002) describe a rare example of realistic unsupervised grammar induction using a\n","cross-entropy approach on binary-branching parsing trees, that is, by forcing the system to generate a hierarchical\n","representation.\n","2512  \n","\n","NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (ALMOST) FROM SCRATCH\n","Since training times for such large scale systems are counted in weeks, it is not feasible to\n","try many combinations of hyperparameters. It also makes sense to speed up the training time by\n","initializing new networks with the embeddings computed by earlier networks. In particular, we\n","found it expedient to train a succession of networks using increasingly large dictionaries, each\n","network being initialized with the embeddings of the previous network. Successive dictionary sizes\n","and switching times are chosen arbitrarily. Bengio et al. (2009) provides a more detailed discussion\n","of this, the (as yet, poorly understood) “curriculum” process.\n","For the purposes of model selection we use the process of “breeding”. The idea of breeding\n","is instead of trying a full grid search of possible values (which we did not have enough computing\n","power for) to search for the parameters in analogy to breeding biological cell lines. Within each line,\n","child networks are initialized with the embeddings of their parents and trained on increasingly rich\n","data sets with sometimes different parameters. That is, suppose we have k processors, which is much\n","less than the possible set of parameters one would like to try. One chooses k initial parameter choices\n","from the large set, and trains these on the k processors. In our case, possible parameters to adjust\n","are: the learning rate l , the word embedding dimensions d, number of hidden units n1 and input\n","hu\n","window size d . One then trains each of these models in an online fashion for a certain amount\n","win\n","of time (i.e., a few days), and then selects the best ones using the validation set error rate. That is,\n","breeding decisions were made on the basis of the value of the ranking criterion (17) estimated on\n","a validation set composed of one million words held out from the Wikipedia corpus. In the next\n","breeding iteration, one then chooses another set of k parameters from the possible grid of values\n","that permute slightly the most successful candidates from the previous round. As many of these\n","parameter choices can share weights, we can effectively continue online training retaining some of\n","the learning from the previous iterations.\n","Very long training times make such strategies necessary for the foreseeable future: if we had\n","been given computers ten times faster, we probably would have found uses for data sets ten times\n","bigger. However, we should say we believe that although we ended up with a particular choice of\n","parameters, many other choices are almost equally as good, although perhaps there are others that\n","are better as we could not do a full grid search.\n","In the following subsections, we report results obtained with two trained language models.

Previous semi-supervised approaches for NLP can be roughly categorized as\n","follows:\n","• Ad-hoc approaches such as Rosenfeld and Feldman (2007) for relation extraction.\n","• Self-training approaches, such as Uefﬁng et al. (2007) for machine translation, and McClosky\n","et al. (2006) for parsing. These methods augment the labeled training set with examples from\n","the unlabeled data set using the labels predicted by the model itself. Transductive approaches,\n","such as Joachims (1999) for text classiﬁcation can be viewed as a reﬁned form of self-training.\n","• Parameter sharing approaches such as Ando and Zhang (2005); Suzuki and Isozaki (2008).\n","Ando and Zhang propose a multi-task approach where they jointly train models sharing cer-\n","tain parameters. They train POS and NER models together with a language model (trained on\n","15 million words) consisting of predicting words given the surrounding tokens. Suzuki and\n","Isozaki embed a generative model (Hidden Markov Model) inside a CRF for POS, Chunking\n","and NER. The generative model is trained on one billion words. These approaches should\n","be seen as a linear counterpart of our work. Using multilayer models vastly expands the\n","parameter sharing opportunities (see Section 5).\n","Our approach simply consists of initializing the word lookup tables of the supervised networks\n","with the embeddings computed by the language models. Supervised training is then performed as\n","in Section 3.5. In particular the supervised training stage is free to modify the lookup tables. This\n","sequential approach is computationally convenient because it separates the lengthy training of the\n","2514  \n","\n","NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (ALMOST) FROM SCRATCH\n","Approach POS CHUNK NER SRL\n","(PWA) (F1) (F1) (F1)\n","Benchmark Systems 97.24 94.29 89.31 77.92\n","NN+WLL 96.31 89.13 79.53 55.40\n","NN+SLL 96.37 90.33 81.47 70.99\n","NN+WLL+LM1 97.05 91.91 85.68 58.18\n","NN+SLL+LM1 97.10 93.65 87.58 73.84\n","NN+WLL+LM2 97.14 92.04 86.96 58.34\n","NN+SLL+LM2 97.20 93.63 88.67 74.15\n","Table 8: Comparison in generalization performance of benchmark NLP systems with our (NN) ap-\n","proach on POS, chunking, NER and SRL tasks.

We report with (LMn)\n","performance of the networks trained from the language model embeddings (Table 7). Gen-\n","eralization performance is reported in per-word accuracy (PWA) for POS and F1 score for\n","other tasks.\n","language models from the relatively fast training of the supervised networks. Once the language\n","models are trained, we can perform multiple experiments on the supervised networks in a rela-\n","tively short time. Note that our procedure is clearly linked to the (semi-supervised) deep learning\n","procedures of Hinton et al. (2006), Bengio et al. (2007) and Weston et al. (2008).\n","Table 8 clearly shows that this simple initialization signiﬁcantly boosts the generalization per-\n","formance of the supervised networks for each task. It is worth mentioning the larger language\n","model led to even better performance. This suggests that we could still take advantage of even\n","bigger unlabeled data sets.\n","4.6 Ranking and Language\n","There is a large agreement in the NLP community that syntax is a necessary prerequisite for se-\n","mantic role labeling (Gildea and Palmer, 2002). This is why state-of-the-art semantic role labeling\n","systems thoroughly exploit multiple parse trees. The parsers themselves (Charniak, 2000; Collins,\n","1999) contain considerable prior information about syntax (one can think of this as a kind of in-\n","formed pre-processing).\n","Our system does not use such parse trees because we attempt to learn this information from the\n","unlabeled data set. It is therefore legitimate to question whether our ranking criterion (17) has the\n","conceptual capability to capture such a rich hierarchical information. At ﬁrst glance, the ranking\n","task appears unrelated to the induction of probabilistic grammars that underly standard parsing\n","algorithms. The lack of hierarchical representation seems a fatal ﬂaw (Chomsky, 1956).\n","However, ranking is closely related to an alternative description of the language structure: op-\n","erator grammars (Harris, 1968). Instead of directly studying the structure of a sentence, Harris\n","deﬁnes an algebraic structure on the space of all sentences. Starting from a couple of elementary\n","sentence forms, sentences are described by the successive application of sentence transformation\n","operators. The sentence structure is revealed as a side effect of the successive transformations.\n","Sentence transformations can also have a semantic interpretation.\n","2515  \n","\n","COLLOBERT, WESTON, BOTTOU, KARLEN, KAVUKCUOGLU AND KUKSA\n","In the spirit of structural linguistics, Harris describes procedures to discover sentence trans-\n","formation operators by leveraging the statistical regularities of the language. Such procedures are\n","obviously useful for machine learning approaches. In particular, he proposes a test to decide whether\n","two sentences forms are semantically related by a transformation operator. He ﬁrst deﬁnes a ranking\n","criterion (Harris, 1968, Section 4.1):\n","“Starting for convenience with very short sentence forms, say ABC, we choose a\n","particular word choice for all the classes, say B C , except one, in this case A; for every\n","q q\n","pair of members A , A of that word class we ask how the sentence formed with one\n","i j\n","of the members, that is, A B C compares as to acceptability with the sentence formed\n","i q q\n","with the other member, that is, A B C .”\n","j q q\n","These gradings are then used to compare sentence forms:\n","“It now turns out that, given the graded n-tuples of words for a particular sentence\n","form, we can ﬁnd other sentences forms of the same word classes in which the same\n","n-tuples of words produce the same grading of sentences.”\n","This is an indication that these two sentence forms exploit common words with the same syntac-\n","tic function and possibly the same meaning. This observation forms the empirical basis for the\n","construction of operator grammars that describe real-world natural languages such as English.\n","Therefore there are solid reasons to believe that the ranking criterion (17) has the conceptual\n","potential to capture strong syntactic and semantic information. On the other hand, the structure\n","of our language models is probably too restrictive for such goals, and our current approach only\n","exploits the word embeddings discovered during training.\n","5. Multi-Task Learning\n","It is generally accepted that features trained for one task can be useful for related tasks. This idea\n","was already exploited in the previous section when certain language model features, namely the\n","word embeddings, were used to initialize the supervised networks.\n","Multi-task learning (MTL) leverages this idea in a more systematic way. Models for all tasks\n","of interests are jointly trained with an additional linkage between their trainable parameters in the\n","hope of improving the generalization error. This linkage can take the form of a regularization\n","term in the joint cost function that biases the models towards common representations. A much\n","simpler approach consists in having the models share certain parameters deﬁned a priori. Multi-\n","task learning has a long history in machine learning and neural networks. Caruana (1997) gives a\n","good overview of these past efforts.\n","5.1 Joint Decoding versus Joint Training\n","Multitask approaches do not necessarily involve joint training. For instance, modern speech recog-\n","nition systems use Bayes rule to combine the outputs of an acoustic model trained on speech data\n","and a language model trained on phonetic or textual corpora (Jelinek, 1976). This joint decoding\n","approach has been successfully applied to structurally more complex NLP tasks. Sutton and McCal-\n","lum (2005b) obtain improved results by combining the predictions of independently trained CRF\n","models using a joint decoding process at test time that requires more sophisticated probabilistic\n","2516  \n","\n","NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (ALMOST) FROM SCRATCH\n","inference techniques. On the other hand, Sutton and McCallum (2005a) obtain results somewhat\n","below the state-of-the-art using joint decoding for SRL and syntactic parsing. Musillo and Merlo\n","(2006) also describe a negative result at the same joint task.\n","Joint decoding invariably works by considering additional probabilistic dependency paths be-\n","tween the models. Therefore it deﬁnes an implicit supermodel that describes all the tasks in the\n","same probabilistic framework. Separately training a submodel only makes sense when the train-\n","ing data blocks these additional dependency paths (in the sense of d-separation, Pearl, 1988). This\n","implies that, without joint training, the additional dependency paths cannot directly involve unob-\n","served variables. Therefore, the natural idea of discovering common internal representations across\n","tasks requires joint training.\n","Joint training is relatively straightforward when the training sets for the individual tasks con-\n","tain the same patterns with different labels. It is then sufﬁcient to train a model that computes\n","multiple outputs for each pattern (Suddarth and Holden, 1991). Using this scheme, Sutton et al.\n","(2007) demonstrate improvements on POS tagging and noun-phrase chunking using jointly trained\n","CRFs. However the joint labeling requirement is a limitation because such data is not often avail-\n","able. Miller et al. (2000) achieves performance improvements by jointly training NER, parsing,\n","and relation extraction in a statistical parsing model. The joint labeling requirement problem was\n","weakened using a predictor to ﬁll in the missing annotations.\n","Ando and Zhang (2005) propose a setup that works around the joint labeling requirements. They\n","deﬁne linear models of the form f (x) = w⊤ F (x) + v⊤ YQ (x) where f is the classiﬁer for the i-th\n","i i i i\n","task with parameters w and v . Notations F (x) and Y (x) represent engineered features for the pat-\n","i i\n","tern x. Matrix Q maps the Y (x) features into a low dimensional subspace common across all tasks.\n","Each task is trained using its own examples without a joint labeling requirement. The learning pro-\n","cedure alternates the optimization of w and v for each task, and the optimization of Q to minimize\n","i i\n","the average loss for all examples in all tasks. The authors also consider auxiliary unsupervised tasks\n","for predicting substructures. They report excellent results on several tasks, including POS and NER.\n","5.2 Multi-Task Benchmark Results\n","Table 9 reports results obtained by jointly trained models for the POS, CHUNK, NER and SRL tasks\n","using the same setup as Section 4.5. We trained jointly POS, CHUNK and NER using the window\n","approach network. As we mentioned earlier, SRL can be trained only with the sentence approach\n","network, due to long-range dependencies related to the verb predicate. We thus performed additional\n","experiments, where all four tasks were trained using the sentence approach network. In both cases,\n","all models share the lookup table parameters (2). The parameters of the ﬁrst linear layers (4) were\n","shared in the window approach case (see Figure 5), and the ﬁrst the convolution layer parameters (6)\n","were shared in the sentence approach networks.\n","For the window approach, best results were obtained by enlarging the ﬁrst hidden layer size to\n","n1 = 500 (chosen by validation) in order to account for its shared responsibilities. We used the\n","hu\n","same architecture as SRL for the sentence approach network. The word embedding dimension was\n","kept constant d0 = 50 in order to reuse the language models of Section 4.5.\n","Training was achieved by minimizing the loss averaged across all tasks. This is easily achieved\n","with stochastic gradient by alternatively picking examples for each task and applying (16) to all the\n","parameters of the corresponding model, including the shared parameters. Note that this gives each\n","task equal weight. Since each task uses the training sets described in Table 1, it is worth noticing\n","2517  \n","\n","COLLOBERT, WESTON, BOTTOU, KARLEN, KAVUKCUOGLU AND KUKSA\n","Lookup Table Lookup Table\n","xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxLTxxxxxxxxxx...W1xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n","xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxLTxxxxxWKxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n","Linear Linear\n","M 1 × ·\n","n1hu n1hu\n","HardTanh HardTanh\n","xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n","Linear Linear\n","M 2 × · M 2 × ·\n","(t1) (t2)\n","n2hu,(t1) = #tags n2hu,(t2) = #tags\n","Task 1 Task 2\n","xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n","Figure 5: Example of multitasking with NN.

For instance, Ratnaparkhi (1996) uses inputs representing\n","word sufﬁxes and preﬁxes up to four characters. We achieve this in the POS task by adding discrete\n","word features (Section 3.2.1) representing the last two characters of every word. The size of the\n","sufﬁx dictionary was 455. This led to a small improvement of the POS performance (Table 10,\n","row NN+SLL+LM2+Sufﬁx2). We also tried sufﬁxes obtained with the Porter (1980) stemmer and\n","obtained the same performance as when using two character sufﬁxes.\n","6.2 Gazetteers\n","State-of-the-art NER systems often use a large dictionary containing well known named entities\n","(e.g., Florian et al., 2003). We restricted ourselves to the gazetteer provided by the CoNLL chal-\n","lenge, containing 8, 000 locations, person names, organizations, and miscellaneous entities. We\n","trained a NER network with 4 additional word features indicating (feature “on” or “off”) whether\n","the word is found in the gazetteer under one of these four categories. The gazetteer includes not\n","only words, but also chunks of words. If a sentence chunk is found in the gazetteer, then all words in\n","the chunk have their corresponding gazetteer feature turned to “on”. The resulting system displays\n","a clear performance improvement (Table 10, row NN+SLL+LM2+Gazetteer), slightly outperforming\n","the baseline. A plausible explanation of this large boost over the network using only the language\n","model is that gazetteers include word chunks, while we use only the word representation of our\n","language model. For example, “united” and “bicycle” seen separately are likely to be non-entities,\n","while “united bicycle” might be an entity, but catching it would require higher level representations\n","of our language model.\n","6.3 Cascading\n","When one considers related tasks, it is reasonable to assume that tags obtained for one task can be\n","useful for taking decisions in the other tasks. Conventional NLP systems often use features obtained\n","from the output of other preexisting NLP systems. For instance, Shen and Sarkar (2005) describe a\n","chunking system that uses POS tags as input; Florian et al. (2003) describes a NER system whose\n","inputs include POS and CHUNK tags, as well as the output of two other NER classiﬁers. State-of-\n","the-art SRL systems exploit parse trees (Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Punyakanok et al., 2005), related\n","to CHUNK tags, and built using POS tags (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1999).\n","Table 10 reports results obtained for the CHUNK and NER tasks by adding discrete word fea-\n","tures (Section 3.2.1) representing the POS tags. In order to facilitate comparisons, instead of using\n","the more accurate tags from our POS network, we use for each task the POS tags provided by the\n","corresponding CoNLL challenge. We also report results obtained for the SRL task by adding word\n","features representing the CHUNK tags (also provided by the CoNLL challenge). We consistently\n","obtain moderate improvements.\n","6.4 Ensembles\n","Constructing ensembles of classiﬁers is a proven way to trade computational efﬁciency for general-\n","ization performance (Bell et al., 2007). Therefore it is not surprising that many NLP systems achieve\n","state-of-the-art performance by combining the outputs of multiple classiﬁers.

Winning a challenge is of course a legitimate objective. Yet it is often difﬁcult to\n","ﬁgure out which ideas are most responsible for the state-of-the-art performance of a large ensemble.\n","Because neural networks are nonconvex, training runs with different initial parameters usually\n","give different solutions. Table 11 reports results obtained for the CHUNK and NER task after ten\n","training runs with random initial parameters. Voting the ten network outputs on a per tag basis\n","(“voting ensemble”) leads to a small improvement over the average network performance. We\n","have also tried a more sophisticated ensemble approach: the ten network output scores (before\n","sentence-level likelihood) were combined with an additional linear layer (4) and then fed to a new\n","sentence-level likelihood (13). The parameters of the combining layers were then trained on the\n","existing training set, while keeping the ten networks ﬁxed (“joined ensemble”). This approach did\n","not improve on simple voting.\n","These ensembles come of course at the expense of a ten fold increase of the running time. On\n","the other hand, multiple training times could be improved using smart sampling strategies (Neal,\n","1996).\n","We can also observe that the performance variability among the ten networks is not very large.\n","The local minima found by the training algorithm are usually good local minima, thanks to the\n","oversized parameter space and to the noise induced by the stochastic gradient procedure (LeCun\n","et al., 1998).

These embeddings\n","improve the generalization performance on all tasks (Section 4.) The literature describes other ways\n","to induce word representations. Mnih and Hinton (2007) proposed a related language model ap-\n","proach inspired from Restricted Boltzmann Machines. However, word representations are perhaps\n","more commonly inferred from n-gram language modeling rather than purely continuous language\n","models. One popular approach is the Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992a), which\n","builds hierarchical word clusters by maximizing the bigram’s mutual information. The induced\n","word representation has been used with success in a wide variety of NLP tasks, including POS\n","(Schu¨tze, 1995), NER (Miller et al., 2004; Ratinov and Roth, 2009), or parsing (Koo et al., 2008).\n","Other related approaches exist, like phrase clustering (Lin and Wu, 2009) which has been shown to\n","work well for NER. Finally, Huang and Yates (2009) have recently proposed a smoothed language\n","modeling approach based on a Hidden Markov Model, with success on POS and Chunking tasks.\n","While a comparison of all these word representations is beyond the scope of this paper, it is\n","rather fair to question the quality of our word embeddings compared to a popular NLP approach.\n","In this section, we report a comparison of our word embeddings against Brown clusters, when used\n","as features into our neural network architecture. We report as baseline previous results where our\n","word embeddings are ﬁne-tuned for each task. We also report performance when our embeddings\n","are kept ﬁxed during task-speciﬁc training. Since convex machine learning algorithms are common\n","practice in NLP, we ﬁnally report performances for the convex version of our architecture.\n","For the convex experiments, we considered the linear version of our neural networks (instead of\n","having several linear layers interleaved with a non-linearity). While we always picked the sentence\n","approach for SRL, we had to consider the window approach in this particular convex setup, as the\n","sentence approach network (see Figure 2) includes a Max layer. Having only one linear layer in our\n","neural network is not enough to make our architecture convex: all lookup-tables (for each discrete\n","feature) must also be ﬁxed. The word-lookup table is simply ﬁxed to the embeddings obtained from\n","our language model LM2. All other discrete feature lookup-tables (caps, POS, Brown Clusters...)\n","are ﬁxed to a standard sparse representation.

Critical Discussion\n","Although we believe that this contribution represents a step towards the “NLP from scratch” objec-\n","tive, we are keenly aware that both our goal and our means can be criticized.\n","The main criticism of our goal can be summarized as follows. Over the years, the NLP com-\n","munity has developed a considerable expertise in engineering effective NLP features. Why should\n","they forget this painfully acquired expertise and instead painfully acquire the skills required to train\n","large neural networks? As mentioned in our introduction, we observe that no single NLP task really\n","covers the goals of NLP. Therefore we believe that task-speciﬁc engineering (i.e., that does not gen-\n","eralize to other tasks) is not desirable. But we also recognize how much our neural networks owe to\n","previous NLP task-speciﬁc research.\n","The main criticism of our means is easier to address. Why did we choose to rely on a twenty\n","year old technology, namely multilayer neural networks? We were simply attracted by their ability\n","to discover hidden representations using a stochastic learning algorithm that scales linearly with\n","25.

Most of the neural network technology necessary for our work has been\n","described ten years ago (e.g., Le Cun et al., 1998). However, if we had decided ten years ago to train\n","the language model network LM2 using a vintage computer, training would only be nearing com-\n","pletion today. Training algorithms that scale linearly are most able to beneﬁt from such tremendous\n","progress in computer hardware.\n","8. Conclusion\n","We have presented a multilayer neural network architecture that can handle a number of NLP tasks\n","with both speed and accuracy. The design of this system was determined by our desire to avoid\n","task-speciﬁc engineering as much as possible. Instead we rely on large unlabeled data sets and let\n","the training algorithm discover internal representations that prove useful for all the tasks of interest.\n","Using this strong basis, we have engineered a fast and efﬁcient “all purpose” NLP tagger that we\n","hope will prove useful to the community.\n","Acknowledgments\n","We acknowledge the persistent support of NEC for this research effort.

Neural Network Gradients\n","We consider a neural network fq (·), with parameters q .
